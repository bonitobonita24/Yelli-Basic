# Spec-Driven Platform V32.1 — Cross-AI Audit Prompt (for ChatGPT)

> **Purpose:** Hand this prompt to ChatGPT along with the 17 V32.1 framework files. ChatGPT independently audits V32.1 to verify the framework remains internally consistent across all canonical files. Items 1-7 below are historical V31-era audit goals (still verified as baseline); V32 and V32.1 verification items live in **Section K (K.1-K.15)** with the V32.1 verified counts block:
> 1. Phase 2.8 (Clickable Mockup Review — added V31) is correctly documented
> 2. Cline deprecation (in-place V31 update) is consistent across all files
> 3. Historical V30 changelog references are preserved
> 4. Memory system (Resume Session, Governance Sync, Feature Update, Log Lesson, Governance Retro) still works with Claude Code as primary
> 5. Foundation intact: L1-L6 security stack, 9 governance docs, Rule 24 fresh context, file ownership model
> 6. No regressions introduced during the updates
> 7. Post-lock additive patches: Phase 3.5, Phase 4+8 anti-thrashing, Skill Installer, Prompt 4.13, attribution cleanup, prompt count 55 (V31 era — V32.1 current: **59 prompts (36 NEW ✨)**, **35 scenarios**, **19 bootstrap steps**)
>
> **How to interpret counts:** The **V32.1 verified counts block** (around line 85 below) is authoritative for current totals. Historical changelog entries and items 1-7 above may reference older totals reflecting their version-at-time-of-writing (e.g., 55 prompts, 34 scenarios, 18 bootstrap steps for V31 lock) — those are correct for their version and **MUST NOT be treated as current**. When a count appears without a V32.1 annotation, cross-check against the verified counts block before reporting.
>
> **Use case:** Run this after every major framework update to catch mistakes Claude missed.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHATGPT

You are an independent auditor reviewing the **Spec-Driven Platform V31** framework. This version has the following changes from V30:

**Original V31 lock (two changes from V30):**
1. **Phase 2.8 — Clickable Mockup Review** added to the Planning Assistant chat
2. **Cline deprecated in-place** — Cline is no longer the fallback builder. Claude Code handles ALL work. Cline infrastructure (`.cline/` folders, `.clinerules` file) is RETAINED but marked unused.

**Post-lock additive patches (no version bump — still V31):**
3. **Phase 3.5 — Execution Plan Generation** — auto-runs after Phase 3 (context cost estimation, task decomposition, Skill Installer activation)
4. **Phase 4 anti-thrashing rule** — mandatory scope assessment, 12-file threshold, module-by-module sub-sessions
5. **Phase 8 anti-thrashing rule** — same 12-file threshold, per-feature sub-batches, mandatory completeness check before committing
6. **Skill Installer integration** — Primary Group 6 slots, per-phase supplementary skills
7. **Prompt 4.13** — Add Automation to Existing Project (n8n / OpenClaw / Hybrid, 7-step flow)
8. **Attribution cleanup** — CLAUDE_CODE first, CLINE removed from active attribution chain
9. **Prompt count** updated from 54 → 59 (36 NEW ✨)
10. **code-review-graph setup signal** — Phase 6 completion + Phase 7 pre-flight
11. **Context Budget — Global Principle** — Sonnet 4.6 model-aware task sizing added to CLAUDE_v31_compact.md and Master_Prompt_v31.md. Every task must be scoped to ≤80K tokens SAFE zone.
12. **Prompt 3.19** — Emergency Anti-Thrashing for any phase (Sonnet 4.6 calibrated, 3 variants)
13. **Memory Governance Layer (V31.1)** — new file `memory-governance.md` with 5 sections: Tiered Decomposition Engine, Smart Checkpoint Protocol, Phase Hooks (13 hooks across all phases), Architect-Execute Model (Opus 4.6 plans → Sonnet 4.6 executes), Mid-Project Adoption
14. **Prompts 3.20 + 3.21** — Memory Governance Baseline + Opus Planning Session
15. **Dispatch Discipline Patch (V31.4)** — Architect-Execute Model extended to ALL phases + ad-hoc edits; Sonnet Scout sub-step added (§4 step 1.5); Tier 1 rewritten to mandate Sonnet dispatch; §3 hook MODEL line and phases.md MODEL: lines rewritten in imperative form

I am attaching 16 V31 framework files. Your job is to verify ALL changes were implemented correctly AND that the foundational Spec-Driven Platform architecture remains intact.

**Do NOT suggest new features.** Do NOT recommend changes to the framework's philosophy. Your job is ONLY to verify:

1. Phase 2.8 is correctly documented wherever it appears
2. Cline is consistently marked deprecated across all files
3. Historical V30 references preserved (changelog entries describing what V30 did must STILL say V30)
4. Cross-file references (filenames, phase counts, agent routing) are internally consistent
5. Memory system commands all still function (Resume Session, Governance Sync, Feature Update, Governance Retro, Log Lesson, Resume from handoff)
6. Foundation intact: L1-L6 security stack, 9 governance docs, Rule 24 fresh context, file ownership model
7. Post-lock patches are present in the correct files (Phase 3.5, anti-thrashing rules, Skill Installer, Prompt 4.13, attribution, prompt count)
8. V31.4 Dispatch Discipline Patch present: universal Architect-Execute scope, Sonnet Scout step 1.5, Tier 1 dispatch mandate, imperative MODEL lines in §3 and phases.md
9. No regressions

## V31 ARCHITECTURE — UNDERSTAND THIS BEFORE AUDITING

### What V31 IS (Two-Part Change)

**PART A — Phase 2.8 Addition**
Runs in the **Planning Assistant chat (Claude.ai)** — NOT in Claude Code. Generates a clickable React (.jsx) mockup with realistic industry-appropriate data using shadcn/ui conventions. After user confirms, Step 7a generates an HTML archive version. User verifies spec interpretation BEFORE Phase 3 locks the architecture.

**PART B — Cline Deprecation (In-Place V31 Update)**
Cline was the fallback builder in V30. In V31 in-place update, Cline is marked **⚠ DEPRECATED — do not use** across all framework files. Claude Code handles everything Cline used to handle. The `.cline/` folder structure AND `.clinerules` file are **retained** because:
- `.cline/memory/lessons.md`, `.cline/STATE.md`, `.cline/memory/agent-log.md`, `.cline/handoffs/` are still actively written by Claude Code (file paths preserved for historical continuity)
- `.clinerules` file is still generated by Bootstrap Step 3 (framework structure preserved) but nothing actively reads it

Bonito's user preference: keep Cline extension installed in VS Code as emergency fallback option; framework itself never routes to Cline.

### What V31 IS NOT

- V31 does NOT add new framework rules (Master Prompt count stays at 30). Planning Assistant has its own Rule 11 (Automation Opt-In) — this is a Planning Assistant rule, not a framework rule.
- V31 adds 2 new scenarios (Scenario 33 — DESIGN.md integration with shadcn/ui; Scenario 34 — CREDENTIALS.md Agent-Proof Upgrade; count 32 → 34)
- V31 does NOT add new bootstrap steps (count stays at 18)
- V31 does NOT change the PRODUCT.md required sections (automation sections in Integrations are CONDITIONAL — only appear when user opts in)
- V31 does NOT change security, UI rules, or deployment procedures
- V31 does NOT affect Claude Code behavior during Phase 3+ (Phase 2.8 is Planning Assistant only)
- V31 does NOT delete `.cline/` folders or `.clinerules` (Cline is deprecated, not removed)
- V31 does NOT introduce new MCP servers or agents
- V31 adds n8n + OpenClaw automation signal detection to Planning Assistant (Rule 11, Step 5 signal check, Step 7 conditional infra question, conditional Integrations template). This is opt-in only — zero footprint when not used.
- Post-lock patches add Phase 3.5 as a NEW phase (between Phase 3 and Phase 4) and anti-thrashing rules to Phase 4 and Phase 8. These are in phases.md and Master_Prompt_v31.md. They do NOT change the framework rule count, scenario count, or bootstrap step count.
- Post-lock patches add a **Context Budget — Global Principle** to CLAUDE_v31_compact.md and Master_Prompt_v31.md. This is a Sonnet 4.6 model-aware task sizing principle (200K window, 120K practical, ≤80K SAFE zone, 12-file threshold). It governs how ALL work is scoped — not a new rule, but a non-negotiable behavioral principle.

### V32.1 verified counts (must match in every file that quotes them)

```
30 Rules · 35 Scenarios · 19 Bootstrap Steps · 8 Phase 4 Parts
9 Phase 5 Commands · 16 Phase 6.5 Categories · 16 Secure Code Gen sub-sections
11 UI Component Rules · 84 Security Checklist items (13 sections)
59 Prompts (36 NEW ✨) in Prompt_References.md and Prompt_References.html
17 deliverable files (16 in .ai_prompt/ + deploy-v31.sh at project root) · 4 MCP servers (3 wired + 1 plugin) · Node v22 · pnpm@10
Phase count: 8 main phases + 2.5 + 2.6 + 2.7 + 2.8 (V31) + 3.5 (POST-LOCK) + 6.5
6 agents (Claude Code primary: Opus 4.6 Architect + Sonnet 4.6 Executor · Cline ⚠ DEPRECATED · Copilot · SpecStory · SocratiCode · code-review-graph)
9 governance docs (unchanged)
Planning Assistant: 11 rules (Rule 11 = n8n+OpenClaw automation opt-in)
```

Count diffs vs V31.3:
- All counts unchanged. V31.4 is a behavioral/governance patch only (no new scenarios, bootstrap steps, rules, or prompts).

Count diffs V31.2 → V31.3 (preserved for historical reference):
- Scenarios: 34 → 35 (added Scenario 35 — Loading state for a custom (non-shadcn) component)
- Bootstrap Steps: 18 → 19 (added Step 19 — Loading Library Lock)
- UI Component Rules: 10 → 11 (added Rule 11 — Loading states dual-path)

        Phase 2.8 mockup tags)
      - scenarios.md (Scenario 35 — Loading state for a custom (non-shadcn) component)
      - bootstrap.md (Step 19 — Loading Library Lock; appends LOCKED entry to DECISIONS_LOG.md +
        lessons.md typed entry + agent-log.md; NO npm install at Bootstrap)
      - templates.md (UI LOADING STATE TEMPLATES section with PATH A snippets — Card/TableRow/

## AUDIT CHECKLIST — Report PASS / FAIL per item

### SECTION A — Phase 2.8 Implementation (9 items)

```
□ A.1  Product_md_Planning_Assistant_v31.md contains a complete Phase 2.8 section
       LOOK FOR: "## 🟦 PHASE 2.8 — CLICKABLE MOCKUP REVIEW (NEW V31)"
       Must include: trigger logic, Step 1-6 execution, industry dummy data theme table,
                     HTML structure spec, Tier 1 fidelity checklist, user response handling,
                     output contract, MUST/MUST NOT rules

□ A.2  Phase 2.8 tier rules: exactly 5-8 Tier 1 screens at full fidelity

□ A.3  Phase 2.8 skip mechanism: "skip mockup" trigger + auto-skip for <2 screens

□ A.4  Phase 2.8 budget limits: Max 3 full regenerations + 5 single-screen expansions

□ A.5  Phase 2.8 ephemeral: NEVER committed to repo, NEVER logged in governance docs

□ A.6  Industry dummy data themes: ERP, Fisheries, Inventory, Healthcare, Education,
       Fintech, Government + Other fallback

□ A.7  shadcn/ui DESIGN CAPABILITY DECLARATION present with HSL color tokens

□ A.8  Planning Assistant WHO YOU ARE: "Product Specification Writer + Visual Design
       Preview Generator"

□ A.9  Master_Prompt_v31.md, phases.md, CLAUDE_v31_compact.md all reference Phase 2.8
       consistently as Planning Assistant chat only, NOT Claude Code, NOT Cline
```

### SECTION B — Cline Deprecation Consistency (15 items — NEW, verify carefully)

```
□ B.1  CLAUDE_v31_compact.md agent stack table shows Cline as ⚠ DEPRECATED
       LOOK FOR: "Cline             ⚠ DEPRECATED — do not use. Kept for historical reference only."

□ B.2  Master_Prompt_v31.md HOW TO USE section explicitly marks Cline deprecated
       LOOK FOR: "Cline → ⚠ DEPRECATED — do not use. Kept in framework for historical reference only."

□ B.3  Master_Prompt_v31.md H4 agent table Cline entry rewritten as DEPRECATED
       LOOK FOR table row: "Cline | ⚠ DEPRECATED (V31)"

□ B.4  Master_Prompt_v31.md session banner agent mode shows Cline deprecated
       LOOK FOR: "Cline → ⚠ DEPRECATED"

□ B.5  AI_Tools_Skills_MCPs_Reference_v31.md agent stack table: Cline marked ⚠ DEPRECATED

□ B.6  Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md Section 1.3 Cline: rewritten as ⚠ DEPRECATED
       Must include V31 change history entry documenting the in-place deprecation

□ B.7  Scenario 19 rewritten: title is "Cline is deprecated — use Claude Code (with Copilot
       as emergency fallback)" — polarity inverted vs V30 which called it "No Cline credits"

□ B.8  Every Phase "Who:" line in Master_Prompt_v31.md and phases.md routes to Claude Code
       Check Phase 2.6, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 — NONE should say "Who: Cline" as active routing

□ B.9  No active-routing Cline verbs anywhere — "Cline runs", "Cline writes", "Cline reads",
       "Cline handles", etc. should all be "Claude Code runs/writes/reads/handles"

□ B.10 No "Open Cline" or "in Cline panel" routing instructions — should be
       "Open Claude Code" / "in Claude Code terminal"

□ B.11 `.cline/` folder structure PRESERVED in Bootstrap (Step 1 folder creation) AND
       .clinerules file STILL GENERATED by Bootstrap Step 3 (marked unused)

□ B.12 Every `.cline/memory/lessons.md`, `.cline/STATE.md`, `.cline/memory/agent-log.md`
       file-path reference still intact — these are PATHS, not routing to Cline

□ B.13 Governance Sync trigger: "Via Claude Code" as primary, Copilot as emergency fallback
       (previously was "Via Cline" as primary)

□ B.14 Feature Update trigger: "Via Claude Code" as primary, Copilot as emergency fallback

□ B.15 Feature Rollback trigger: "Via Claude Code" as primary, Copilot as emergency fallback
```

### SECTION C — Historical V30 Reference Preservation (7 items)

These items MUST remain as "V30" because they describe what V30 did historically.

```
□ C.1  Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md V30 row "Compact CLAUDE.md Architecture
       + Claude Sonnet 4.6 Primary" — MUST say V30

□ C.2  V30 changelog entries describing promotion/demotion of agents preserved as V30

□ C.3  Master_Prompt_v31.md v29 → v30 changelog block describes V30 features as V30

□ C.4  Bootstrap Step 18 credential scaffold marked "(V30 — non-blocking — no interview)"
       because scaffold was introduced in V30

□ C.5  (NEW V28), (NEW V29), (NEW V30) markers on historical features unchanged

□ C.6  Version history tables V10 through V30 intact in all files

□ C.7  Cline historical changelog in Feature Index (V10, V13, V14, V19, V30 entries) intact
       IMPORTANT: V30 row in Cline history says "Demoted to fallback builder" — this
       should stay because Cline was demoted in V30. V31 added "⚠ DEPRECATED" as a
       NEW history row — both should coexist.
```

### SECTION D — Current-Version Reference Consistency (14 items)

```
□ D.1  CLAUDE_v31_compact.md header: "# SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM — V31"
□ D.2  CLAUDE_v31_compact.md session start: "✅ Spec-Driven Platform V31 loaded"
□ D.3  Master_Prompt_v31.md header: "# SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM — V31"
□ D.4  Master_Prompt_v31.md agent role: "V31 STRICTEST discipline"
□ D.5  Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md header: "Current framework version: V31"
□ D.6  Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md footer 16-file list: ALL versioned files have _v31 suffix
□ D.7  AI_Tools_Skills_MCPs_Reference_v31.md agent table: Claude Code shows "V31 primary"
□ D.8  Post_Generation_Security_Checklist_v31.md header: "— V31"
□ D.9  Post_Generation_Security_Checklist_v31.md Section 13: "V31 VALIDATION"
□ D.10 Prompt_References.md header: "Prompt References — Spec-Driven Platform V31"
□ D.11 Prompt_References.md deploy command: "bash deploy-v31.sh"
□ D.12 deploy-v31.sh header references V31 throughout
□ D.13 Planning Assistant file version: "PRODUCT.md Planning Assistant — v31"
□ D.14 Planning Assistant greeting: "PRODUCT.md Planning Assistant v31 loaded"
```

### SECTION E — Count Preservation (13 items)

```
□ E.1  Rule count = 30 in all files that mention it
□ E.2  Scenario count = 34 in all files that mention it
□ E.3  Bootstrap steps = 18 in all files that mention it
□ E.4  Security Checklist items = 84 across 13 sections

□ E.7  Phase 6.5 Categories = 16 in all files
□ E.8  Secure Code Gen sub-sections = 16 in all files
□ E.9  UI Component Rules = 10 in all files
□ E.10 Deliverable file count = 16 in all files that mention it (15 in .ai_prompt/ + deploy-v31.sh at project root)
□ E.11 MCP servers = 4 (3 wired + 1 plugin)
□ E.12 Node v22, pnpm@10 referenced consistently
□ E.13 6 agents still listed (Cline remains as 6th but marked deprecated — count stays 6)
```

### SECTION F — Foundational Architecture Intact (10 items — NEW, verify carefully)

These MUST remain intact post-Cline-deprecation. If any are broken, the Spec-Driven
Platform foundation is compromised.

```
□ F.1  Governance docs read order preserved

       PRE-READ (per Rule 24 — NOT part of the numbered 9):
         .cline/STATE.md — FIRST thing every session, fresh-start safety

       THE 9 GOVERNANCE DOCS (numbered 1-9):
       1. .cline/memory/lessons.md (🔴 gotchas then 🟤 decisions first)
       2. docs/PRODUCT.md
       3. inputs.yml
       4. inputs.schema.json
       5. docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
       6. docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md
       7. docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
       8. project.memory.md
       9. .cline/memory/agent-log.md

       NOTE: CLAUDE_v31_compact.md lists only the 9 (STATE.md covered in Rule 24).
       Master_Prompt_v31.md lists STATE.md as "0" (pre-read) then 1-9.
       Both representations are valid — verify that BOTH patterns appear where
       expected (compact = 9 only; Master = 0 + 9). Do NOT flag either as FAIL.

□ F.2  File ownership model intact
       HUMAN-OWNED: docs/PRODUCT.md · CLAUDE.md · .clinerules · .vscode/mcp.json
       AGENT-OWNED: everything else
       NEVER COMMIT: CREDENTIALS.md · .env.dev · .env.staging · .env.prod

□ F.3  L1-L6 security stack preserved (canonical definitions — match files exactly)
       L1 — tRPC tenantId scoping (app layer)  [DEFERRED in single-tenant, activated 2+ tenants]
       L2 — PostgreSQL RLS (database layer — written as comments, enabled on multi-tenant upgrade)
       L3 — RBAC middleware (ACTIVE — prevents privilege escalation in any app)
       L4 — PgBouncer pool limits (DEFERRED — only meaningful with 2+ tenants)
       L5 — Immutable AuditLog (ACTIVE — every mutation logged for privacy + traceability)
       L6 — Prisma extension ($allOperations) — auto-injects tenantId on every query

       NOTE: DB isolation strategy (shared schema + tenant_id vs separate schema for
       payroll/banking/medical) is an ARCHITECTURAL decision documented in PRODUCT.md
       and DECISIONS_LOG.md — NOT part of the L1-L6 security stack itself. Do not
       conflate them.

□ F.4  Rule 24 (Fresh context per Phase 4 Part + STATE.md) preserved
       Description now attributes work to Claude Code, not Cline

□ F.5  Rule 18 (Structured lessons.md typed entries) preserved
       Claude Code writes typed entries; 🔴 gotchas, 🟤 decisions, 🟡 fixes

□ F.6  SpecStory passive capture preserved
       Auto-saves every Claude Code session to .specstory/history/

□ F.7  Memory commands all still function:
       "Resume Session" + 3 docs → Claude Code restores context ✓
       "Governance Sync" + 9 docs → Claude Code reconciles docs ✓
       "Feature Update" → Claude Code reads 9 docs + implements + attributes ✓
       "Governance Retro" → Claude Code outputs structured retrospective ✓
       "Log Lesson" script → adds typed entry to lessons.md ✓
       "Resume from handoff: [file]" → Claude Code recovers from error state ✓

□ F.8  6 agents still listed (Cline counted but deprecated):
       1. Claude Code (primary V31)
       2. Cline (⚠ DEPRECATED V31)
       3. Copilot (inline autocomplete + emergency fallback)
       4. SpecStory (passive capture)
       5. SocratiCode (MCP semantic search)
       6. code-review-graph (MCP blast-radius)

□ F.9  Phase 2.8 does not affect Claude Code / Cline behavior
       Phase 2.8 runs in Planning Assistant chat ONLY
       Zero Phase 3+ impact

□ F.10 Bootstrap Step 3 still writes .clinerules (even though Cline deprecated)
       File marked "⚠ Cline DEPRECATED V31 — file still generated for historical parity but unused"
```

### SECTION G — Regression Checks (8 items)

```
□ G.1  No active routing to Cline anywhere — no Phase "Who: Cline" lines,
       no "Open Cline" instructions, no "Cline runs/writes/reads" statements

□ G.2  No orphaned features — every phase still has an active owning agent
       (Claude Code for all Phase 0-8 work)

□ G.3  No conflicting agent stack language — everywhere that lists agents,
       Cline is shown consistently as ⚠ DEPRECATED

□ G.4  No "Cline as primary" or "Cline is the primary" claims anywhere

□ G.5  No stale "use Cline fallback when Claude Code is unavailable" instructions —
       should now say "use Copilot as emergency fallback" (or similar)

□ G.6  Phase 2.8 correctly scoped to Planning Assistant chat only

□ G.7  No claim that V31 added rules / bootstrap steps / agents / MCP servers
       (post-lock additive scenarios ARE valid — current count: 34. Verify changelog documents them.)

□ G.8  No stale v27/v28/v29/v30 filename references in adoption instructions
       (should say v31 as current version)
```

### SECTION H — Phase 2.8 Technical Correctness (10 items)

```
□ H.1  Mockup is React (.jsx) primary format (shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Inter font).
       HTML archive generated in Step 7a after user confirmation.
□ H.2  shadcn/ui color tokens in HSL format
□ H.3  Inter font from rsms.me CDN
□ H.4  showScreen(id) JS function for client-side navigation
□ H.5  Tier 2 placeholder screens still navigable
□ H.6  Dummy data 15-25 rows per table
□ H.7  PH-grounded examples (Filipino business names, PHP currency)
□ H.8  Banner: "📐 PHASE 2.8 MOCKUP" identifier
□ H.9  No live functionality (forms don't submit, data doesn't save)
□ H.10 Icons restricted to lucide-react only
```

### SECTION I — Automation Integration: n8n + OpenClaw (7 items)

```
□ I.1  Planning Assistant Rule 11 exists and defines opt-in automation posture
       (n8n signals, OpenClaw signals, hybrid signals, ask-once behavior, defer to user)

□ I.2  Step 5 contains "Automation signal check" sub-step that runs SILENTLY
       after conditional features — does NOT ask unprompted if no signals detected

□ I.3  Step 7 contains CONDITIONAL automation infrastructure question
       that ONLY fires when Step 5 accepted a workflow — never asks otherwise

□ I.4  PRODUCT.md Integrations template has conditional "External Automation —
       n8n + OpenClaw" sub-section with workflow table (name, type, trigger,
       endpoint, handoff doc, fallback) — marked CONDITIONAL, omitted when not used

□ I.5  Infrastructure Notes template references n8n-handoff.md and
       openclaw-handoff.md as conditional gitignored entries

□ I.6  n8n-handoff.md and openclaw-handoff.md are in .gitignore across all
       three sources: bootstrap.md Step 8, Master_Prompt_v31.md Step 8,
       deploy-v31.sh GITIGNORE_ENTRIES

□ I.7  Zero automation footprint when not used: if no workflow accepted in
       Step 5, the output PRODUCT.md must contain NO mention of n8n, OpenClaw,
       handoff docs, or automation webhook endpoints
```

       "## §2 — SMART CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL"
       "## §3 — PHASE HOOKS"

       File count should say 17 deliverable files (not 16)

□ J.21 [V31.2 historical — SUPERSEDED by V32 K.2/K.3] memory-governance.md originally added (V31.2) Step 2.5
       (30K token budget gate) and Step 2.5b (Opus escalation). V32 has SUPERSEDED both: token estimation
       replaced by `wc -l` file-size checks (Step 2.5 gone, see K.2); Step 2.5b deleted entirely (see K.3).
       For V32 verification, use K.2 and K.3 instead. This item is retained for V31.2-history audits only.
       LOOK FOR: V32 changelog block in Master_Prompt_v31.md explaining the supersession of Step 2.5 and Step 2.5b.
       PASS if K.2 and K.3 both pass. Do NOT fail V32 for the absence of Step 2.5b — its removal is intentional.

□ J.22 Prompts 3.20 + 3.21 exist in Prompt_References.md and .html
       LOOK FOR: "## 3.20 — Memory Governance Baseline" and "## 3.21 — Opus Planning Session"

□ J.23 Prompt count is 59 (not 54, 55, or 56) across all files that state a count
       MUST NOT find "54 prompts" or "55 prompts" or "56 prompts" or
       "31 New" or "32 New" or "33 New" anywhere

□ J.24 (V31.4) Architect-Execute Model scope universality — ALL phases + ad-hoc edits
       LOOK FOR in memory-governance.md §4: language that says the model applies to
       ALL phases AND ad-hoc edits — NOT limited to Phase 4/7/8 only.
       Grep across all 17 files: zero matches for scope-limiting phrase "Phase 4/7/8"
       OUTSIDE of historical changelog blocks. Any such match outside a changelog is a FAIL.
       ALSO CHECK: CLAUDE_v31_compact.md and AI_Tools_Skills_MCPs_Reference_v31.md
       must NOT contain scope-limiting "Phase 4/7/8" language in the Architect-Execute description.

□ J.25 (V31.4) Sonnet Scout sub-step exists in §4 Execution Flow
       LOOK FOR in memory-governance.md §4 Execution Flow: a step 1.5 (or equivalent
       numbered sub-step) that mandates dispatching a Sonnet "scout" subagent
       BEFORE the main decomposition when ANY of these thresholds are met:
         - reading >2 PRODUCT.md sections, OR
         - reading >2 governance docs, OR
         - touching >5 source files.
       The scout's job: read and summarize, then return results to Opus for decomposition.
       FAIL if step 1.5 is absent, or if the thresholds listed above are not present.

□ J.26 (V31.4) Tier 1 mandates Sonnet dispatch — NOT "proceed directly"
       LOOK FOR in memory-governance.md §1 Tiered Decomposition Engine:
       Tier 1 action text MUST read "Dispatch to single Sonnet subagent..." (or equivalent
       imperative dispatch language). It MUST NOT say "Proceed directly."
       ALSO CHECK Tier 2: must explicitly mandate Sonnet dispatch with a planned split
       (not merely "consider splitting" or advisory language).
       FAIL if either Tier 1 says "proceed directly" OR Tier 2 lacks a dispatch mandate.

□ J.27 (V31.4) Phase hook MODEL line uses imperative "STOP" language
       LOOK FOR in memory-governance.md §3 Phase Hooks: the MODEL line (or MODEL block)
       MUST use imperative form — specifically "STOP before executing..." and MUST include
       the restriction: "Opus's only allowed actions: read, plan, decompose, review."
       And MUST state: "All file writes MUST be dispatched [to Sonnet]."
       FAIL if MODEL line is advisory ("Use Architect-Execute Model...") rather than imperative.
       FAIL if Opus write restriction is absent.

□ J.28 (V31.4) phases.md MODEL: lines use imperative form — no advisory wording remaining
       LOOK FOR in phases.md: ALL occurrences of "MODEL:" lines.
       Each MUST match the imperative form from §3 (e.g., "STOP before executing...").
       MUST NOT contain advisory phrases like "Use Architect-Execute Model for this phase"
       or "Architect-Execute Model recommended."
       MUST NOT contain phase-specific scope language like "for Phase X work" that would
       imply the model only applies to that phase.
       FAIL if any single MODEL: line in phases.md remains in advisory form.

□ J.29 (V31.4) Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md V31.4 row exists + footer bumped
       LOOK FOR: a V31.4 row in the version table of Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md
       describing the Dispatch Discipline Patch (universal scope, Sonnet Scout, Tier 1
       mandate, imperative hook MODEL line, phases.md MODEL line alignment).
       ALSO CHECK: the footer / "current version" marker in Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md
       must show V31.4 as the latest version — NOT V31.3.
       FAIL if V31.4 row is missing. FAIL if footer still says V31.3.

### Section K — V32 / V32.1 Verification (Zero Opus Execution Dispatch System + Sonnet Subagent Context Overhead)

□ K.1 (V32) — Zero Opus Execution rule (R1) is documented in memory-governance.md §4
       LOOK FOR in `memory-governance.md` §4 "Opus Role (strictly limited — V32 R1)": an explicit
       "OPUS MAY NOT" block listing: Edit on project files, Write on project files (except STATE.md),
       "small justified escalation" (banned phrase), Agent(model: "opus") for execution.
       FAIL if Opus is allowed to call Edit/Write on project files for any reason.

□ K.2 (V32) — File-Size Dispatch (R2) replaces token estimation
       LOOK FOR in `memory-governance.md` §1: tier classification based on `wc -l` line counts,
       NOT estimated tokens. Tier 1 ≤ 500 total lines AND ≤ 4 files AND 1 module.
       Tier 2 = 501-1500. Tier 3 > 1500.
       FAIL if §1 still references "30K token budget" or "Step 2.5" token estimation.

□ K.3 (V32) — Step 2.5b deleted
       LOOK FOR: `memory-governance.md` should NOT have a "Step 2.5b" subsection.
       The Opus executor escalation path is REMOVED in V32.
       Historical mentions in changelog blocks (explaining what was removed) are acceptable.
       FAIL if §1 or §4 still describes Opus escalation as an operational path.

□ K.4 (V32) — Large-File Guard (R3) — files > 300 lines need line ranges
       LOOK FOR in `memory-governance.md` §1 Step 4 and §4 Task Scope Format:
       Files > 300 lines MUST have explicit line ranges in the task scope.
       FAIL if Task Scope Format does not mention line ranges for large files.

□ K.5 (V32) — Failure = Split (R4) — no Opus fallback
       LOOK FOR in `memory-governance.md` §1 "Failure Protocol" and §4 "BLOCKED" / "THRASHING":
       3 re-decomposition attempts → defer to next session. NEVER fall back to Opus execution.
       FAIL if BLOCKED handling allows Opus to take over implementation.

□ K.6 (V32) — Scout-Before-Edit (R5) — files > 200 lines
       LOOK FOR in `memory-governance.md` §4 step 1.5: Sonnet Scout is mandatory (not just optional)
       for files > 200 lines, > 2 PRODUCT.md sections, > 2 governance docs, OR > 5 source files.
       FAIL if Scout is described as fully optional or limited to "large reads" without size threshold.

□ K.7 (V32) — All 5 MODEL hooks in phases.md updated to V32 form
       LOOK FOR in `phases.md`: 5 MODEL hooks (Phase 2, 3.5, 4, 7, 8) all begin
       "MODEL: ZERO OPUS EXECUTION (V32)." and reference the 500-line `wc -l` gate explicitly.
       FAIL if any of the 5 still uses pre-V32 language ("STOP before executing" without "ZERO OPUS EXECUTION").

□ K.8 (V32) — CLAUDE_v31_compact.md Agent Stack reflects V32
       LOOK FOR in `CLAUDE_v31_compact.md` Agent Stack: Opus 4.6 = Architect ONLY (planning,
       decomposition, review, STATE.md checkpoint), NEVER calls Edit/Write on project files.
       FAIL if there is still a line listing "Opus 4.6 = Executor (last resort)" or Step 2.5b.

□ K.9 (V32) — Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md V32 row exists + footer bumped
       LOOK FOR: a V32 row in the version table above the V31.4 row, describing the
       Zero Opus Execution Dispatch System. Footer reads "Last updated: V32 (...)".
       FAIL if V32 row is missing. FAIL if footer still says V31.4.

□ K.10 (V32) — Master_Prompt_v31.md V32 changelog block present
       LOOK FOR: a `### V32 (2026-05-27) — Zero Opus Execution Dispatch System` section in
       the changelog, appearing BEFORE the V31.4 entry. Contains: WHY (V31.4 failed in Yelli),
       WHAT V32 CHANGES (5 rules R1-R5), Files changed, Counts unchanged.
       FAIL if no V32 changelog block exists.
□ K.11 (V32.1) — memory-governance.md §1 contains "Operational Note — Sonnet Subagent Context Overhead (V32.1)" subsection (symptoms, mitigation, R4 relationship, when-it-matters)
□ K.12 (V32.1) — Prompt 3.21 (Opus Planning) in Prompt_References.md AND Prompt_References.html contains "V32.1 Dispatch Sizing Tip" callout linking to memory-governance.md V32.1 note
□ K.13 (V32.1) — Master_Prompt_v31.md changelog contains V32.1 entry positioned above the V32 entry
□ K.14 (V32.1) — Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md contains V32.1 table row above V32 row, footer bumped to "Last updated: V32.1"
□ K.15 (V32.1) — CLAUDE_v31_compact.md title bumped to "V32.1", and V32.1 Operational Note paragraph present after the dispatch gate paragraph
□ K.16 (V32.1.1) — Product_md_Planning_Assistant_v31.md Step 7d (Final handoff) routes Bootstrap FIRST → "Start Phase 2" → "Start Phase 3"
       LOOK FOR in `Product_md_Planning_Assistant_v31.md` Step 7d Final handoff Output text:
       the phrase "run 'Bootstrap' FIRST (creates CREDENTIALS.md — required gate for Phase 2)"
       followed by "THEN 'Start Phase 2'" and the operational-questions list (Docker Hub credentials,
       model routing, dev port ranges, git strategy, CORS origins), and finally
       "After Phase 2 confirms, type 'Start Phase 3' to generate inputs.yml".
       FAIL if Step 7d still tells users to run "Start Phase 3" directly without Bootstrap + Phase 2 first.
       FAIL if Step 7d does not mention CREDENTIALS.md as the Phase 2 gate.
□ K.17 (V32.1.1) — Prompt_References.md Prerequisites lists 17 V32 framework files + Planning Assistant deliverables include DESIGN.md + mockup HTML
       LOOK FOR in `Prompt_References.md` Prerequisites section: a bullet stating
       "17 V32 framework files (16 in `.ai_prompt/` + `deploy-v31.sh` at project root)"
       AND a bullet mentioning DESIGN.md + mockup HTML archive as optional Planning Assistant deliverables
       AND a cross-reference to Appendix A for the V32 `spec-update` workflow.
       FAIL if Prereqs still says "16 V31 files" or omits DESIGN.md/mockup mention.
□ K.18 (V32.1.1) — Prompt_References.md Starting State diagram contains memory-governance.md AND docs/DESIGN.md AND docs/mockups/
       LOOK FOR in `Prompt_References.md` "## The Starting State" ascii block:
       row for `memory-governance.md` inside `.ai_prompt/`, AND
       row for `docs/DESIGN.md` with annotation "from Planning Assistant Step 7b — if you picked a getdesign.md aesthetic", AND
       row for `docs/mockups/` with annotation "from prompt 4.7 — if you saved the Phase 2.8 mockup HTML archive".
       FAIL if any of the three rows is missing.
       FAIL if the diagram still says "15 V31 reference files".
□ K.19 (V32.1.1) — Prompt_References.md 1.3.2 renamed "Phase 2 operational interview" + 1.3.3 contains Phase 2.8 SKIPPED note
       LOOK FOR in `Prompt_References.md`:
       (a) `### 1.3.2 — Phase 2 operational interview` (NOT "Phase 2 discovery") followed by body text explaining
           Phase 2 is NOT a duplicate of Planning Assistant and listing the operational questions it asks
           (Docker Hub, model routing, dev ports, git, CORS, Komodo, Turnstile).
       (b) Section 1.3.3 auto-chain line contains "Phase 2.8 is SKIPPED in Claude Code — it already ran in the Planning Assistant chat".
       FAIL if 1.3.2 still says "Phase 2 discovery" or "Claude only asks remaining open questions".
       FAIL if 1.3.3 does not explicitly say Phase 2.8 is skipped in Claude Code.
□ K.20 (V32.1.1) — Master_Prompt_v31.md changelog contains V32.1.1 entry dated 2026-05-28
       LOOK FOR in `Master_Prompt_v31.md` changelog: a bullet beginning
       "**V32.1.1 (2026-05-28):** Planning Assistant Step 7d corrected." inside the V32.1 changelog section
       (positioned after the V32.1 entries, before the V32 entry).
       The bullet must describe: old behavior (skipped Bootstrap + Phase 2), new behavior
       (Bootstrap → Phase 2 → Phase 3), propagation to Prompt_References.md + .html, and rationale
       (Master Prompt = sole authority, Planning Assistant must match).
       FAIL if V32.1.1 entry is absent or dated differently.
□ K.21 (V32.1.2) — AI_Tools_Skills_MCPs_Reference_v31.md Claude Code agent row describes V32 Zero Opus Execution
       LOOK FOR in `AI_Tools_Skills_MCPs_Reference_v31.md` the Claude Code row of the agent table:
       row must say "Opus 4.6 = Architect ONLY", "NEVER calls Edit/Write on project files",
       "Sonnet 4.6 = Sole Executor", "`wc -l` ≤ 500 total lines per task", and explicitly call out
       that "Step 2.5/2.5b (30K token budget gate + Opus executor escalation) was the V31.2-era model
       and is REMOVED in V32" as a historical note.
       FAIL if active row still describes "fallback Executor" or "30K token budget" as live behavior.
□ K.22 (V32.1.2) — AI_Tools_Skills_MCPs_Reference_v31.md footer says 17-file V32.1 deliverable set
       LOOK FOR: footer line "*This reference is part of the 17-file V32.1 deliverable set (16 files placed in `.ai_prompt/` + deploy script at project root):*"
       followed by file listing that includes memory-governance.md and ChatGPT_V31_Cross_Audit_Prompt.md and Prompt_References.html.
       FAIL if footer still says "13-file V31 deliverable set".
□ K.23 (V32.1.2) — Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md header says current version V32.1
       LOOK FOR near top: "> Current framework version: **V32.1**" with explanation that
       filenames retain `_v31_` for deploy backward compatibility.
       FAIL if header still says "Current framework version: **V31**".
□ K.24 (V32.1.2) — Framework_Feature_Index_v31.md Note line at end says 17-file V32.1 deliverable set + memory-governance.md
       LOOK FOR the "**Note:** This file is updated by Claude alongside every version bump..." paragraph
       near the file end: must say "17-file V32.1 deliverable set — 16 files in `.ai_prompt/`"
       and the file listing must include memory-governance.md.
       FAIL if Note still says "16-file V31 deliverable set" or omits memory-governance.md.
□ K.25 (V32.1.2) — CLAUDE_v31_compact.md role block says V32.1 STRICTEST + Master_Prompt header has V32.1.2 naming-policy note
       LOOK FOR in `CLAUDE_v31_compact.md` near top: "operating under **V32.1 STRICTEST** discipline"
       (NOT "V31 STRICTEST"). AND in `Master_Prompt_v31.md` header area: a block titled
       "**VERSION + FILENAME POLICY (added V32.1.2 — 2026-05-28)**" explaining that body labels saying
       "V31 primary" / "V31 STRICTEST" should be interpreted as base-V31 with V32/V32.1 patches layered on.
       FAIL if either is absent.
□ K.26 (V32.1.3) — deploy-v31.sh count messages consistent with 17-file canonical (16 in .ai_prompt/ + 1 deploy script)
       LOOK FOR in `deploy-v31.sh`:
       (a) Header layout block (around line 49) says "put all 16 V32 reference files in here".
       (b) Footer comment (around line 66) says "this script at project root (17th file — total deliverable set)".
       (c) Missing-folder error path says "put the 16 V32 reference files in it" — NOT "15 V32 reference files".
       FAIL if any of the three messages uses 13, 14, 15, or 17 in the .ai_prompt/ reference count
       (the .ai_prompt/ folder always holds 16 files; deploy-v31.sh is the 17th = total set).
□ K.27 (V32.1.4) — deploy-v31.sh "Next steps" message conditionally routes based on Planning Assistant artifact detection
       LOOK FOR in `deploy-v31.sh` (around the post-deploy "Next steps" block):
       (a) A `pa_signal` variable initialized to 0 and set to 1 when
           `[ -f "$PROJECT/docs/PRODUCT.md" ] && { [ -f "$PROJECT/docs/DESIGN.md" ] || [ -f "$PROJECT/docs/MOCKUP.jsx" ]; }` is true.
       (b) An `if [ "$pa_signal" -eq 1 ]; then ... else ... fi` branch around the "Next steps" echo lines.
       (c) PA-branch output mentions "Bootstrap" (Phase 0), "Start Phase 2" (operational interview), "Start Phase 3" (inputs.yml from PRODUCT.md),
           AND explicitly states "Phase 2.8 is SKIPPED in Claude Code" (because the mockup already ran in Planning Assistant).
       (d) PA-branch output offers prompt 1.2 (Universal Analyzer) as a fallback for users who'd rather auto-detect.
       (e) Non-PA branch retains the previous behavior (recommend pasting prompt 1.2 from Prompt References).
       FAIL if the Next-steps message is unconditional (always recommends 1.2 OR always recommends Bootstrap).
       FAIL if PA-branch does not mention Bootstrap → Phase 2 → Phase 3 in that order.
       FAIL if PA-branch does not mention "Phase 2.8 is SKIPPED" explicitly.
       Rationale: deploy script now resolves the V32.1.1 (Planning Assistant "type Bootstrap") vs prior deploy-script
       ("paste prompt 1.2") contradiction by picking the right entry point from observable target state.

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR CHATGPT

1. **Do not be lenient.** Bonito asks for this audit precisely because Claude (the LLM that made the changes) may miss its own errors. Report every real inconsistency.

2. **Do not invent features.** If a checklist item describes something that isn't actually in the files, report the gap — but don't suggest the feature should do more than specified.

3. **Distinguish FAIL from PARTIAL carefully.** A FAIL is factually wrong. A PARTIAL is ambiguous or incomplete coverage.

4. **Quote evidence.** Every PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL must include the file and a line quote or section reference. No hand-waving.

5. **Cline deprecation is in-place V31 — no version bump.** The framework stays V31. Cline is marked deprecated but retained structurally (folders, .clinerules file, historical changelog entries). Only active routing changed to Claude Code.

6. **Historical V30 changelog entries MUST stay as V30.** If you see "V30: Compact CLAUDE.md architecture" in a changelog, that's correct — V30 added that. V31 did NOT add that.

7. **`.cline/` folder path references are file paths, not Cline routing.** Claude Code reads and writes these files. Do NOT flag `.cline/memory/lessons.md` as a Cline reference — it's a file path that happens to use that folder name for historical continuity.

8. **False positives waste everyone's time.** If you can't find something with evidence, mark PARTIAL and explain — don't fabricate a FAIL.

9. **V31 is additive: Planning Assistant (Phase 2.8 + Rule 11 Automation) + Cline-deprecation-in-place + Scenario 33-34 + post-lock patches.** Planning Assistant Rule 11 is a Planning Assistant rule — it does NOT increment the framework's 30-rule count. Framework rule count stays at 30. Post-lock patches (Phase 3.5, anti-thrashing, Skill Installer, Prompt 4.13, attribution cleanup) were applied after V31 lock with no version bump.

10. **Memory system verification is critical.** If ANY memory command (Resume Session, Governance Sync, Feature Update, Governance Retro, Log Lesson, Resume from handoff) appears broken or has stale Cline routing as primary, flag as F.7 FAIL immediately — this is Bonito's most important concern.

11. **V31.1 / V31.2 / V31.3 / V31.4 are post-lock patches inside the V31 line** — additive changes that did not bump the major version. **V32 (2026-05-27) IS a full version bump** — it replaces the dispatch model structurally (token estimation → file-size checks, Step 2.5b removed). Treat V31.x patches as historical; treat V32 as the current authoritative state. The K section verifies V32; the J section retains historical V31.x items for audit completeness. V31.1 is a minor version tag for the Memory Governance Layer — still within V31. V31.2 added the 30K Token Budget Gate (Step 2.5) and Opus Escalation (Step 2.5b) — both SUPERSEDED by V32. V31.3 added the UI Loading-State Dual-Path (Rule 11, Scenario 35, Bootstrap Step 19, phantom-ui). V31.4 is the Dispatch Discipline Patch — it extended the Architect-Execute Model from Phase 4/7/8 only to ALL phases + ad-hoc edits, added a Sonnet Scout sub-step (§4 step 1.5), rewrote Tier 1 to mandate Sonnet dispatch (removing "proceed directly"), and rewrote phase hook MODEL lines and all phases.md MODEL: lines in imperative form. ChatGPT should verify patches exist in the correct files (Section J) but should NOT flag them as version inconsistencies. Phase 3.5 is a new phase — verify it appears in phase menus and counts. Anti-thrashing rules are in Phase 4 and Phase 8 sections. Context Budget is a global principle in CLAUDE_v31_compact.md and Master_Prompt_v31.md. Memory Governance Layer is in memory-governance.md with 13 hooks in phases.md. Architect-Execute Model uses Sonnet 4.6 (executor); Opus dispatched only by explicit human instruction. Prompt count is 59 (not 54, 55, or 56). Deliverable file count is 17 (not 16). Attribution chain is CLAUDE_CODE first (not CLINE).
