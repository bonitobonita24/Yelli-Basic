# Spec-Driven Platform V31 — Phase Details

> **V32.7 LOAD INSTRUCTION:** This file is no longer auto-loaded. It lives in `.ai_prompt/`.
> **`Read .ai_prompt/phases.md`** — then read ONLY the section for the phase you are running.
> Also: **`Read .ai_prompt/memory-governance.md`** before running any phase pre-flight hooks.
> Loaded contextually when executing any phase.
> Contains: Phase 1-8, Phase 2.5/2.6/2.7/2.8 sub-phases, Phase 6.5 triage, Resume, Retro, Gov Sync, Toggles.
> Note: Phase 2.8 (Clickable Mockup Review) is documented here for reference but executes ONLY in the Planning Assistant chat on Claude.ai — not by Claude Code.

## ⚠ UNIVERSAL CONTEXT BUDGET — READ BEFORE EVERY PHASE

**This section applies to EVERY phase, part, batch, feature update, and task in this file.
Claude Code MUST apply this budget BEFORE starting any work — not just Phase 4 and Phase 8.**

**You are Claude Sonnet 4.6.** Your context window is 200K tokens but autocompact thrashes
when input context exceeds ~120K. The **SAFE zone is ≤80K tokens of input context.**

**OUTPUT EQUIVALENCE GUARANTEE:**
Splitting tasks into smaller sessions MUST produce the SAME final result as building
everything in one session — except BETTER, because no output is lost to context overflow.
Every file, every function, every validation rule, every permission guard, every UI element
described in PRODUCT.md must exist in the final codebase regardless of how many sessions
it took to build. Splitting changes the SESSION BOUNDARIES, never the OUTPUT.

When splitting, treat each sub-session as if it were the ONLY chance to build that module.
Do not assume a future session will "fill in the gaps." Each sub-session must produce
complete, working, tested code for its assigned scope — not stubs, not placeholders,
not TODO comments. The completeness check before committing enforces this.

**If you see this error, you have already exceeded the budget:**
> "Autocompact is thrashing: the context refilled to the limit within 3 turns
> of the previous compact, 3 times in a row."

```
TOKEN BUDGET REFERENCE (applies to ALL phases):
  CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded, only file):  ~3K
  .ai_prompt/phases.md (this file):    ~40K  (read on demand — current phase section only)
  .ai_prompt/memory-governance.md:     ~6K   (read on demand — at every phase pre-flight)
  Each PRODUCT.md section:            ~2-4K  (full file = 20-40K — NEVER read all at once)
  Each existing source file read:     ~1-3K
  9 governance docs (all):            ~10-15K
  Your output per file written:       ~2-5K
  ─────────────────────────────────
  SAFE threshold: ≤12 files OR ≤80K total estimated tokens
```

**MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT (run at the start of EVERY phase/part/batch/task):**

0. **Load governance files (V32.7 — explicit Read required, not auto-loaded):**
   - `Read .ai_prompt/phases.md` → then find your current phase section below
   - `Read .ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` → then run the phase hooks (§1 PRE + §2 POST + §4 MODEL)
0a. **REGISTRY WORK-START CONSULT (V32.8 — Rule 32):** Before writing any file, consult `LESSONS_REGISTRY.md` for fingerprints matching this phase's target surface. If a matching entry has a `standing_check` → run it now. Skip if `LESSONS_REGISTRY.md` does not yet exist.
1. **Estimate scope** — how many files will you read + create + modify?
2. **Estimate token cost** — use the reference table above
3. **If >12 files OR >80K tokens → SPLIT before starting:**
   - Group by module/feature
   - Report the split plan with estimated tokens per sub-session
   - Build one group at a time → commit → STOP → human opens new session
4. **Read selectively:**
   - PRODUCT.md: read ONLY the sections relevant to the current task
   - Source files: use `codebase_search` (Rule 17) first, open files only when needed
   - Governance docs: read lessons.md + DECISIONS_LOG always; others only if relevant
5. **If thrashing occurs mid-session despite planning:**
   - STOP immediately — do NOT read more files
   - Run `/clear` to free context
   - Save progress: STATE.md + `.cline/handoffs/` + commit
   - STOP — human opens new session with narrower scope

**This is not optional.** Every phase section below assumes this pre-flight has been run.

---

## PHASE 1 — SET UP DEV ENVIRONMENT (OPTIONAL — skip if already done)
**Who:** You | **Where:** WSL2 terminal — this is the only step agents cannot do

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Human-executed phase — no agent context budget concern. Listed here for universal coverage.

**One-time setup. Skip entirely if Node 22, pnpm, and VS Code Remote-WSL are already installed.**

WSL2 native is the only supported dev environment.
Run Node + pnpm natively in WSL2. Only backing services run in Docker Compose.
This eliminates all devcontainer permission layers and shell server crashes.

```
Windows → WSL2 Ubuntu → Node 22 (nvm) + pnpm native
                      → Docker Desktop (backing services only)
                            postgresql, valkey, minio, mailhog
```

Setup (one-time in WSL2 Ubuntu terminal):
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 22 && nvm use 22 && npm install -g pnpm
```

Open project in VS Code via Remote-WSL extension. Run `pnpm dev` in WSL2 terminal.
Start Docker services: `bash deploy/compose/start.sh dev up -d` (from WSL2 terminal).
No devcontainer. No socket negotiation. No shell server crashes.

This step requires a physical action on your machine — no agent can trigger it.

---

## PHASE 2 — DISCOVERY INTERVIEW
**Who:** Claude Code (you interact with it) | **Where:** Terminal — run `claude` in your project folder

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Interview phase — lightweight context. If the interview produces a very large PRODUCT.md (>30K tokens), Phase 3 will handle it with section-by-section reads.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE** (memory-governance.md): PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1) — classify scope before starting. POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if any files were created or modified. MODEL: ZERO OPUS EXECUTION (V32.3). Opus's only allowed actions: (a) READ context — but any non-allow-list file > 100 lines MUST go through Scout-Sonnet (R6); **V32.3:** allow-list governance docs > 200 lines also MUST go through Scout-Sonnet with the Governance Extraction Schema (`memory-governance.md §4`) — direct Opus read of a > 200-line allow-list governance doc counts as `opus_writes` for `dispatch_ratio` purposes; (b) plan, decompose, review Sonnet output — DONE acceptance requires full diff review, review-by-summary FORBIDDEN; (c) WRITE only the R8 Allow-List (docs/STATE.md · docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md · docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md · docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md · .cline/STATE.md). ALL other file writes (code, configs, tests) MUST be dispatched via Agent(subagent_type: "spec-executor") per §4 (fallback: Agent(model: "sonnet") when a task requires tools/MCPs outside spec-executor's allow-list). ≥ 2 independent dispatches MUST be parallel in ONE Opus response — serial only with a real data dependency (R7). Before each dispatch: run `wc -l`; total ≤ 500 lines per Sonnet task; files > 300 lines need explicit line ranges. Smart Checkpoint logs `dispatch_ratio` (sonnet_writes / opus_writes ≥ 3.0; < 1.0 triggers lessons.md drift review — R9). NO exceptions. NO "last resort." NO Opus executor escalation. If about to Edit/Write a non-allow-list file, STOP and dispatch.

Before any files are generated, Claude Code interviews you to understand your app.
This locks in tech stack, tenancy model, entities, security, and infrastructure.

**⚠️ ONE-TIME ONLY per project. Never re-run on an existing project.**
For any change after Phase 4 — always use Phase 7.

**Trigger:** Say "Start Phase 2" + paste your completed `docs/PRODUCT.md`

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 PRE-FLIGHT — CREDENTIALS GATE — MANDATORY
Before running the interview, verify Bootstrap Step 18 completed:
□ CREDENTIALS.md exists in the project root
  - If missing: STOP. Output: "⚠ Bootstrap Step 18 has not run. CREDENTIALS.md is missing.
    Open Claude Code, paste the master prompt, and type 'Bootstrap' to complete setup first."
  - Do not proceed with Phase 2 until CREDENTIALS.md exists.
□ .gitignore contains CREDENTIALS.md entry
  - If missing: add it immediately before any other action.
Note: Phase 2 does not read credential values — check existence only (headers only if verifying).
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Step 1 — Validate PRODUCT.md completeness

Required sections (cannot be blank): App Name, Purpose, Target Users, Core Entities,
User Roles, Main Workflows, Data Sensitivity, Tenancy Model, Environments Needed.

Strip any `<private>` tags before processing (Rule 20). If a required section is
entirely within a `<private>` block, ask the user to provide a non-sensitive description.

If any required section is blank or "TBD" → list them and STOP.

### Step 2 — Acknowledge confirmed tech stack

If Tech Stack Preferences is filled → treat as confirmed → list them → do not re-ask.

### Step 3 — Ask only relevant questions in ONE message

Skip sections clearly not needed (no jobs → skip Section F, etc.):

```
SECTION A — Platform Identity
□ App name in the UI?
□ Production domain? (e.g. inventorize.app, erp.powerbyte.com)
□ Staging domain? (e.g. staging.inventorize.app, staging-erp.powerbyte.com)
  (Dev ports are auto-generated by Phase 3 — do not ask for them)

SECTION B — Tenancy
□ single / multi / start-single-upgrade-later?
□ If multi: subdomain or subdirectory? Any shared global data?

SECTION C — Auth & RBAC
□ Auth provider (if not in PRODUCT.md)?
□ JWT field names? Roles global or tenant-scoped?

SECTION D — Modules & Navigation
□ URL prefix per module? Navigation hardcoded or DB?

SECTION E — File Uploads (skip if none declared)
□ File types + sizes? Store originals? Image variants?

SECTION F — Background Jobs (skip if none declared)
□ Queue names? Retry + backoff? DLQ + replay UI?

SECTION G — Reporting (skip if none declared)
□ KPIs? Chart types? Export formats?

SECTION G2 — Payment Gateway (skip if app does not accept payments)
□ Does this app accept payments from users? (yes / no — skip section entirely if no)
□ Payment gateway: Xendit (framework default for all SEA markets — ID, PH, MY, TH, VN)
  IF yes and Xendit is acceptable: lock `payment.gateway: xendit` in DECISIONS_LOG.md.
  IF the user explicitly requests a different gateway (e.g. Stripe, PayMongo): ask why, then lock.
  Xendit is the default because Powerbyte operates in PH and framework targets SEA.
□ Payment methods needed? (cards, e-wallets, bank transfer, OTC / over-the-counter, QR)
□ Recurring payments / subscriptions needed? (Xendit supports recurring via Plans API)
□ Refund support needed? (full / partial)
□ Multi-currency? (default: single currency per deployment region)
  → Write answers to PRODUCT.md Integrations section under "Payment Gateway"
  → Phase 3 generates payment.* fields in inputs.yml
  → Bootstrap Step 18 Section 4.5 collects Xendit API keys

SECTION H — Security & Governance
□ Which events need audit logs? (login, record CRUD, role changes, etc.)
□ Data retention period, GDPR export/delete requirements?
□ CORS allowed origins per environment?
□ Rate limiting needed? (public / auth / upload endpoints)
□ CSRF approach (cookie-based SameSite / header token)?
□ Cloudflare Turnstile bot protection (V27 — framework default, FREE tier):
  Turnstile is enabled by default on all public-facing forms. No CAPTCHA shown to users.
  Protected pages: login, registration, password reset, contact forms, payment pages (if Xendit enabled).
  Widget mode: Managed (recommended — Cloudflare auto-decides whether to show a checkbox).
  FREE tier limits: 20 widgets (1 per app), 10 hostnames per widget.
  Hostname strategy: only prod domain registered on widget (dev + staging use test keys — 0 hostnames).
  This means 1 hostname used per app. For SaaS with custom tenant domains, each domain = 1 more hostname.
  IF the user explicitly opts out: set turnstile.enabled: false in DECISIONS_LOG.md.
  IF multi-tenant SaaS with custom domains: ask how many unique hostnames — may need multiple widgets.
  → Lock in DECISIONS_LOG.md under "Bot protection": turnstile enabled, widget mode, protected pages list.
  → Bootstrap Step 18 Section 4.6 collects Turnstile sitekey + secret key.

SECTION I — Infrastructure
□ Compose services needed? External in production? K8s confirm disabled?
□ Docker Hub image publishing (NEW V15):
  Do you want to publish a Docker image to Docker Hub on every push to main?
  If yes → ask these 3 questions:

  Q1: Docker Hub username?
      (the username you log into hub.docker.com with — e.g. "bonito" or "powerbyte")

  Q2: Image name for this specific app?
      IMPORTANT — naming rules to avoid Docker Hub collisions:
      • Must be unique within YOUR Docker Hub account
      • Use the app slug, not a generic name: e.g. "nucleus-erp" not "app" or "erp"
      • If you have multiple apps: "nucleus-erp", "marine-guardian", "portal" — each unique
      • Lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces, no slashes: "my-app-name" ✅ "My App" ❌
      • Full image ref will be: yourusername/image-name (e.g. bonito/nucleus-erp)
      • This name is LOCKED in DECISIONS_LOG.md after Phase 3 — changing it later
        means all existing pull commands on staging/prod servers must be updated

  Q3: Do you already have a Docker Hub account?
      If YES: confirm username + that you can create repos (free plan allows unlimited public, 1 private)
      If NO:  create account first at hub.docker.com before continuing Phase 3
              Free plan is sufficient — you only need 1 private repo per app

  If no: skip — no docker-publish.yml, push.sh, or COMMANDS.md Docker section will be generated.
  → Lock in DECISIONS_LOG.md under "Docker image publishing": username, image_name, full ref
  Note: Two push paths are generated when enabled (NEW V22 — both use same Docker Hub repo):
    • GitHub Actions (automatic): pushes :latest + :sha on every merge to main
    • push.sh (manual): bash deploy/compose/push.sh dev → staging → prod
    Both coexist. COMMANDS.md documents all push commands for quick reference.
  Note: If using Komodo for staging/prod deployment (V27 — recommended):
    V27 model uses Komodo auto-update for staging (polls Docker Hub for new :staging-latest images)
    and manual deploy from Komodo UI for production. No webhook URLs or secrets needed for this path.
    OPTIONAL: If you prefer webhook-triggered deploys, add these GitHub Secrets:
      KOMODO_STAGING_WEBHOOK_URL — from Komodo UI → Stack → Config → Webhooks
      KOMODO_PROD_WEBHOOK_URL    — from Komodo UI → Stack → Config → Webhooks
      KOMODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET      — same value as in Komodo Core compose config
    See Scenario 32 for full Komodo setup from scratch.
□ Dev environment mode — PRE-LOCKED (V25):
  MODE A (WSL2 native) — the only supported dev environment. No devcontainer. No DinD.
  Node + pnpm run natively in WSL2. Docker Desktop provides backing services only.
  This decision is written to DECISIONS_LOG.md by Bootstrap Step 9 — never re-ask.
□ Any port ranges to avoid on this machine? (Phase 3 generates non-standard random ports automatically — Rule 22)
□ Git strategy: use branch-per-feature with squash-merge? (default: yes — Rule 23)
□ Git worktrees for Phase 4 Parts? (default: yes — cleaner isolation per Part)
□ Model routing for Claude Code tasks:
  - Planning/Phase 2: Claude Code (auto)
  - Execution/Phase 4-8: [default: Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Claude Code]
  - Governance writes: [default: Gemini Flash-Lite — cheapest]
  → Lock these in DECISIONS_LOG.md under "Model routing"

SECTION J — Mobile (skip if no mobile declared)
□ Framework: React Native bare or Expo (managed/bare workflow)?
□ Offline-first required? If yes: what data needs to work offline?
□ Sync strategy: optimistic updates / background sync / manual sync?
□ Push notifications? Provider: Expo Push / FCM+APNs direct?
□ Camera, GPS, biometrics, or other native device features needed?
□ Deployment: App Store + Play Store, or internal/enterprise only?
□ API auth strategy for mobile: same JWT flow as web, or separate?
□ Deep linking required? (e.g. open app from email link)

SECTION K — Design Identity (skip if not in PRODUCT.md — fully optional)
□ Brand feel? (professional/enterprise | friendly/consumer | premium/luxury | technical/developer)
□ Target aesthetic in plain English? (e.g. "clean like Linear" / "bold like Stripe" / "calm like healthcare")
□ Industry category? (drives anti-pattern filtering in Phase 2.6)
□ Dark mode required? (yes / no / optional toggle)
□ Any key design constraint? (e.g. WCAG AA required / internal tool / low-end device support)
```

### Step 4 — Close Phase 2

Output:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 OUTPUT CONTRACT — MANDATORY
Before proceeding to Phase 2.5, verify ALL of these:
□ docs/PRODUCT.md has all 11 required sections — no blank sections, no "TBD"
□ All roles have at least 2 explicit permissions AND 1 explicit restriction
□ All entities have at least 3 fields named
□ Tenancy model is declared (even if single-tenant)
□ Out of Scope has at least 3 explicit exclusions
□ Internal alignment check = PASS (no gaps)
IF ANY item fails → output GAP_REPORT only → do not advance to Phase 2.5
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

> ✅ Phase 2 complete. Say "Start Phase 3" to review the full spec summary.
> After confirming, run Phase 4 in Claude Code — Part-by-Part, human triggers each phase.

---

## PHASE 2.5 — SPEC DECISION SUMMARY
**Who:** Claude Code | **Where:** VS Code

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Summary phase — reads PRODUCT.md to produce a condensed review. If PRODUCT.md is >30K tokens, read section-by-section and summarize incrementally.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

Trigger: Say "Start Phase 3"

Output the full spec summary for review. Do NOT generate files until user says "confirmed".

```
📋 SPEC DECISION SUMMARY — reply "confirmed" to generate files

APP
  Name / Purpose / Tenancy / Environments / Domains

TECH STACK (TypeScript strict everywhere)
  Frontend / API / ORM / Auth / Database / Cache / Storage / Web UI / Mobile UI

MONOREPO
  Apps: [name, framework, port] / Packages list / Conditional packages

ENTITIES / MODULES / JOBS / INFRA SERVICES
K8s scaffold: disabled

⭐ PRODUCT DIRECTION CHECK
Before locking this spec, ask: "Is this the right product to build?
What would the ideal version of this do that this plan doesn't include yet?"
If the user expands the scope — update the relevant sections above before confirming.
This is a one-question gut check, not a full re-interview. Max 2 minutes.

After confirmation → Phase 2.6 runs automatically (if skill installed + Section K present)
→ then Phase 2.7 spec stress-test runs (blocks Phase 3 if gaps found — "Re-run Phase 2.7" after fixes)
→ then Phase 3 generates spec files → then hand off to Claude Code for Phase 4 Part-by-Part.
(Note: Phase 2.8 Clickable Mockup Review runs separately in the Planning Assistant chat on Claude.ai — BEFORE PRODUCT.md is brought into the project. It does not run here in Claude Code.)
```

---


## PHASE 2.6 — DESIGN SYSTEM GENERATION (NEW V12)
**Who:** Claude Code (automated — Cline deprecated) | **Where:** VS Code — Claude Code terminal
**Trigger:** Runs automatically as part of the "confirmed" → Phase 3 sequence.

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Design system generation reads PRODUCT.md Section K + generates design tokens. Lightweight — but if combined with Phase 2.7 + Phase 3 in one session, estimate total context.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

User says "confirmed" once after Phase 2.5 — Claude Code handles 2.6 then proceeds to Phase 3.
**Prerequisite:** UI UX Pro Max skill installed + Section K in PRODUCT.md.
**Skip condition — CONDITIONAL:** If either is absent → log to agent-log.md → continue to Phase 3 immediately.

```
Step 1 — Check prerequisites
  If .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/ does NOT exist:
    → Append to agent-log.md: "Phase 2.6 skipped — UI UX Pro Max skill not installed"
    → Proceed to Phase 3 immediately
  If PRODUCT.md has no Design Identity section (Section K):
    → Append to agent-log.md: "Phase 2.6 skipped — no Design Identity in PRODUCT.md"
    → Proceed to Phase 3 immediately
  Check for additional design plugins (NEW V23):
  - frontend-design plugin: check if ~/.claude/skills/frontend-design/ exists → log presence
  - a11y skill: check PRODUCT.md Non-functional Requirements for "accessibility: wcag_aa" → flag if present
  - shadcnblocks: check if .claude/skills/shadcn-ui/ exists → log presence (optional)

Step 2 — Extract Design Identity from PRODUCT.md
  Read Section K. Strip any <private> tags (Rule 20).
  Compose search string: "[industry category] [brand feel] [target aesthetic]"

Step 3 — Run design system generator
  Run this single command (all on one line):
  python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "[search string from Step 2]" --design-system --persist -p "[App Name from inputs.yml]"
  Output: design-system/MASTER.md

Step 3a — Append Vercel Web Interface Guidelines to MASTER.md (NEW V23)
  These guidelines are embedded directly rather than loaded as a skill — Vercel's own evals
  showed 100% pass rate with embedded guidelines vs 79% with skill-based loading.
  Append this section to design-system/MASTER.md:

  ## Web Interface Quality Standards (Vercel Guidelines)

  ### Interactions
  - Every interactive element must have a visible focus state (2–4px ring, not just outline-none)
  - Touch targets minimum 44×44px (mobile) — never smaller
  - Hover → active transitions: 150–300ms (below 100ms feels instant/broken, above 400ms feels slow)
  - Disabled states must look disabled — reduced opacity + no pointer-events

  ### Forms
  - Inline validation: show errors on blur, not on submit
  - Required fields must be marked — never rely on placeholder alone
  - Error messages must be adjacent to the field, not just at the top
  - Success feedback must be explicit — never silent

  ### Animations
  - Use CSS transitions/animations only — no JS-based animation for layout shifts
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion: always provide a reduced-motion fallback
  - Page transitions: ≤200ms — longer feels laggy in production apps
  - Loading skeletons > spinners for content areas > 300px tall

  ### Layout
  - Scrollable containers must have visible overflow indicators
  - Sticky headers must not obscure focused elements on keyboard navigation
  - Mobile breakpoint (375px): test before every delivery — never assume desktop-first works

  ### Performance perception
  - Optimistic UI for user actions (create, update, delete) — show change immediately, revert on error
  - No layout shift on data load — skeleton loaders must match final layout dimensions
  - Images must have explicit width/height (Next.js Image component enforces this)

  ### Dark mode
  - Test dark mode contrast independently — do not assume light mode values invert correctly
  - Borders visible in both modes (bg-border not bg-foreground/10)
  - Shadow-based elevation does not work in dark mode — use border + subtle bg difference instead

  ### Keyboard navigation
  - Tab order must follow visual reading order
  - Modal/dialog: trap focus while open, restore focus on close
  - Escape closes modals/dropdowns/drawers — no exceptions
  - Arrow keys navigate menus and listboxes — not Tab

Step 4 — Add design-system entry to .socraticodecontextartifacts.json
  Check if file exists. If it does: MERGE (add entry, do not overwrite).
  If it does not exist yet: create with the design-system entry only.
  Entry to add:
  {
    "name": "design-system",
    "path": "./design-system/MASTER.md",
    "description": "Active design system — colors, typography, spacing, UI style, anti-patterns. Read before generating any UI component, page, or visual element."
  }
  Note: Phase 4 Part 7 will add the remaining 4 entries (database-schema,
  implementation-map, decisions-log, product-definition). Always MERGE, never overwrite.

Step 5 — shadcnblocks catalog (NEW V23 — CONDITIONAL)
  If .claude/skills/shadcn-ui/ exists (shadcnblocks skill installed):
    → Log to agent-log.md: "Shadcnblocks skill detected — Claude has full block catalog (2500+ blocks)"
    → Add note to design-system/MASTER.md:
      "## Block Catalog Available: shadcnblocks 2500+ blocks installed.
       When building page sections (hero, pricing, dashboard, navigation, footer):
       Ask Claude to select from shadcnblocks catalog before writing custom components.
       Install: npx shadcn add @shadcnblocks/[block-name]"
  If not installed: skip silently.

Step 6 — a11y enforcement (NEW V23 — CONDITIONAL)
  If PRODUCT.md Non-functional Requirements contains "accessibility: wcag_aa":
    → Add section to design-system/MASTER.md:
      "## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) — MANDATORY
       This app requires WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
       Before delivering any UI component, verify:
       □ Color contrast: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px bold+)
       □ Focus rings: visible on ALL interactive elements (never outline: none without replacement)
       □ Alt text: all meaningful images have descriptive alt attributes
       □ ARIA labels: all icon-only buttons have aria-label
       □ Keyboard navigation: all interactions reachable and usable without mouse
       □ Form labels: every input has an associated <label> element (not just placeholder)
       □ Error announcement: errors announced via aria-live or role='alert'
       Run /web-interface-guidelines in Claude Code to audit UI code against these standards."
    → If a11y skill is installed: append "Run a11y skill pre-delivery checklist" to Phase 7 task instructions.

Step 7 — Log and summarise
  Append to CHANGELOG_AI.md: Agent: CLAUDE_CODE, Phase 2.6 design system generated
  Output to user:
  ✅ Phase 2.6 complete — Design system generated.
     Style: [style name]
     Colors: [primary] / [secondary] / [CTA]
     Typography: [font pairing]
     Top anti-patterns to avoid: [top 3]
     Vercel UI guidelines: embedded in MASTER.md
     Accessibility: [wcag_aa enforced | standard shadcn/ui defaults]
     Shadcnblocks: [detected — 2500+ blocks available | not installed]
  Proceeding to Phase 3...
```

**If Phase 2.6 is skipped** (skill absent or no Section K):
Claude Code uses shadcn/ui neutral defaults for all UI. Zero errors. Zero blocked phases.
Install the skill and add Section K to PRODUCT.md any time → say "Feature Update" → MASTER.md generated.

---

## PHASE 2.7 — SPEC STRESS-TEST GATE (NEW V19)
**Who:** Claude Code | **Where:** VS Code terminal
**Trigger:** Runs automatically after Phase 2.6 (or after Phase 2.5 if Phase 2.6 skipped).

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Stress-test reads full PRODUCT.md to find gaps. If PRODUCT.md exceeds 30K tokens, read section-by-section and test each independently rather than loading the entire file.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

**Skip condition — CONDITIONAL:** `vibe_test.enabled: false` in inputs.yml → skip entirely → proceed to Phase 3.
**Default:** Enabled. Costs one LLM call. Prevents entire Phase 4 rebuilds from spec gaps.

**Purpose:** Before generating any code or spec files, stress-test `docs/PRODUCT.md` to find
every gap, ambiguity, and missing decision that would force Claude Code to halt or guess during Phase 4.
Output is always exact and actionable — never vague.

**Execute this sequence — MANDATORY, no deviations:**

```
Step 1 — Read docs/PRODUCT.md in full.
  Strip all <private> tags (Rule 20) before analysing.
  Do not output PRODUCT.md content to the user.

Step 2 — Run the 4-category internal stress-test.
  This is INTERNAL ONLY — never output the checklist.
  Check every item silently:

  COMPLETENESS
  □ All 11 required PRODUCT.md sections present and non-empty?
  □ Every module has at least one user flow?
  □ Every entity has key fields named (not just the entity name)?
  □ Every role has at least one permission explicitly listed?
  □ Auth strategy named and confirmed?
  □ Tenancy mode declared (single / multi)?
  □ DB isolation exception declared if payroll/banking/medical data present?
  □ Mobile: offline-first decision made? Distribution type named?
  □ File storage: need declared? Provider named if yes?
  □ Job queue: need declared? Queue names listed if yes?

  CONSISTENCY
  □ Any entity named in workflows but missing from Data Entities section?
  □ Any role referenced in permissions but not declared in Roles section?
  □ Any integration named in flows but not listed in Integrations section?
  □ Tenancy mode consistent across all sections?

  AMBIGUITY
  □ Any workflow step where Claude Code cannot determine which file to create?
  □ Any feature described with 2+ equally valid implementations?
  □ Any "TBD", "to be decided", or blank field not explicitly listed in Out of Scope?

  SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE
  □ Data sensitivity declared? (GDPR / DICT / financial / medical flags)
  □ Audit log events named for every sensitive mutation?
  □ Rate limiting declared for public-facing endpoints?
  □ CORS origins named for all environments?

Step 3 — Evaluate and output.

  IF all checks pass:
  Output EXACTLY this text — no additions:
  ✅ Phase 2.7 complete — spec stress-test PASSED.
     0 gaps found. PRODUCT.md is implementation-ready.
     Proceeding to Phase 3...
  Then proceed to Phase 3 automatically.

  IF any check fails:
  Output EXACTLY this structure. Do NOT proceed to Phase 3:

  🔴 SPEC STRESS-TEST — [N] gap(s) found. Fix before Phase 3.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  GAP 1:
    SECTION:  [which PRODUCT.md section]
    PROBLEM:  [one sentence — what is missing, ambiguous, or inconsistent]
    FIX:      [exact text to add or change in PRODUCT.md]
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [repeat for every gap — do not group or summarise]

  NEXT STEP: Fix all gaps in docs/PRODUCT.md then say "Re-run Phase 2.7".

Step 4 — After all gaps fixed and re-check passes:
  Append to CHANGELOG_AI.md:
    Agent: CLAUDE_CODE
    Phase 2.7 spec stress-test passed. [N] gap(s) found and resolved before Phase 3.
  Proceed to Phase 3.
```

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2.7 OUTPUT CONTRACT — MANDATORY
One of these two outcomes is required before proceeding:
□ PASS: output "✅ Phase 2.7 complete — spec stress-test PASSED. 0 gaps found." then proceed to Phase 3.
□ FAIL: output GAP_REPORT (SECTION/PROBLEM/FIX per gap). Do NOT proceed to Phase 3. Wait for fixes.
IF neither outcome is output → Phase 2.7 = INCOMPLETE → run again before Phase 3.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Re-run trigger:** Say `"Re-run Phase 2.7"` → repeat Steps 1–4 on the updated PRODUCT.md.

**Disabled path:** `vibe_test.enabled: false` in inputs.yml → Phase 2.7 skipped entirely.
Any gaps discovered during Phase 4 will require a Feature Update to resolve — significantly
more expensive than catching them here.

---

## PHASE 2.8 — CLICKABLE MOCKUP REVIEW (NEW V31)

**Who:** Planning Assistant chat (Claude.ai) — NOT Claude Code
**Where:** The same Claude.ai chat that ran Phases 2–2.7 (the PRODUCT.md Planning chat)

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Runs in Planning Assistant (Claude.ai), not Claude Code. Claude.ai has its own context limits — if the PRODUCT.md + mockup generation exceeds the chat window, the Planning Assistant will handle it natively. No agent-side budget concern.

**Trigger:** Auto-runs after Phase 2 Alignment Check passes on the Planning Assistant side
**Skip:** Type `skip mockup` in the Planning Assistant chat. Auto-skipped if PRODUCT.md has <2 screens.

### PURPOSE
Catch spec/mental-model misalignment BEFORE Phase 3 locks the architecture.
Cheap to generate (single HTML file, ~90 seconds), expensive to skip (misinterpretations surface only during Phase 4 scaffold).

### WHAT PHASE 2.8 DOES
1. Parses the just-written PRODUCT.md — extracts every declared screen
2. Classifies into Tier 1 (5-8 critical screens, full fidelity) vs Tier 2 (remaining screens, simplified placeholders)
3. Selects an industry-appropriate dummy data theme (ERP / Fisheries / Inventory / Healthcare / Education / Fintech / Government / Other)
4. Generates a clickable React (.jsx) mockup using shadcn/ui conventions (Tailwind + Inter font + shadcn CSS variable color tokens); HTML archive version generated after user confirmation (Step 7a)
5. Delivers as Claude.ai artifact + downloadable HTML file
6. Asks 3 alignment questions covering navigation structure, primary workflow, data display
7. Handles user response — confirmed, change request, expand Tier-2-to-Tier-1, or skip

### WHO EXECUTES IT
ONLY the Planning Assistant chat (Claude.ai running the PRODUCT.md interview).
Claude Code does NOT run Phase 2.8. When PRODUCT.md arrives at the project
repo, assume Phase 2.8 already ran (or was skipped) on the Planning Assistant side.
(Cline deprecated V31 — same rule applies: if Cline is ever re-enabled as emergency fallback, it must not run Phase 2.8 either.)

### WHAT PHASE 2.8 DOES NOT DO
- Does NOT create or modify any project files
- Does NOT commit the mockup to the repo
- Does NOT log the mockup in governance docs
- Does NOT affect Phase 3 inputs.yml generation in any way
- Does NOT require new rules, scenarios, or bootstrap steps
- Does NOT use any UI library other than shadcn/ui conventions
- Does NOT include live functionality (forms don't submit, data doesn't save)

### FULL SPECIFICATION
See `Product_md_Planning_Assistant_v31.md` — Phase 2.8 section (trigger logic, Step-by-Step, industry theme table, HTML structure spec, Tier 1 fidelity checklist, user response handling, output contract, MUST/MUST NOT rules).

**MODEL HOOK (V32.5 — Phase 2.8 → Phase 3.3 designer-skills hand-off; target updated V32.6):** Planning Assistant Step 7 emits `docs/DESIGN.md` (token baseline) and `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` (visual baseline). These are the **human-verified contract** — Claude Code's designer-skills bundle MUST inherit, never regenerate. At **Phase 3.3** (V32.6 — moved from Phase 4 Parts 5-6), `/design-tokens` EXPANDS the DESIGN.md token table, `/design-review` audits MOCKUP.jsx against the expanded tokens, `/design-refine` runs only on flagged components. This preserves Rule 1 (human approves PA artifacts; Claude Code cannot silently overwrite verified design intent). If PA Step 7 was skipped (no DESIGN.md), Phase 3.3 may invoke `/design-aesthetic` once to establish a baseline + log to PRODUCT.md Section 10 (Scenario 33). **Gate-closure (V32.5.1):** Phase 2.8 cannot close until `/design-review` returns green OR every flag has been resolved by `/design-refine`. A "soft pass" with unresolved flags is NOT permitted — Phase 3 (spec-file generation) MUST NOT begin while the visual baseline carries open audit findings.

### PHASE 3 INTERACTION
Zero. Phase 3 in Claude Code proceeds based on PRODUCT.md + inputs.yml regardless
of whether Phase 2.8 ran, passed, or was skipped. The mockup is ephemeral — used
for visual verification only, not architecture input.

### BUDGET LIMITS
- Max 3 full regenerations per project
- Max 5 single-screen Tier-2→Tier-1 expansions per project
- Budget exhaustion → Planning Assistant recommends proceeding to Phase 3, further iteration during Phase 7 Feature Updates

## PHASE 3 — GENERATE SPEC FILES
**Who:** Claude Code | **Where:** VS Code

Trigger: User says "confirmed" after Phase 2.5

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file) before starting. Phase 3 reads the full PRODUCT.md — if it exceeds 30K tokens, generate spec files in module groups rather than all at once.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3 PRE-FLIGHT — ACCOUNTS & CREDENTIALS CHECKLIST — MANDATORY
Verify these BEFORE generating any files. Ask human to resolve anything missing.

□ Verify CREDENTIALS.md is complete (written by Bootstrap Step 18)
  - If missing or all-placeholder: STOP. Ask human to rerun Bootstrap Step 18 before continuing.
  - Confirm these sections exist: GitHub, Docker Hub, PostgreSQL, Valkey, MinIO, pgAdmin, Auth, SMTP
  - Read section HEADERS only — never log credential values anywhere

□ GitHub account ready (values from CREDENTIALS.md — do NOT re-ask)
  - Repo name confirmed — use value from CREDENTIALS.md GitHub section
  - IF docker.publish: true → remind human to add GitHub Secrets NOW (before first push to main):
      DOCKERHUB_USERNAME  = Docker Hub username (already in CREDENTIALS.md)
      DOCKERHUB_TOKEN     = Docker Hub access token (already in CREDENTIALS.md)
      OPTIONAL — only if using webhook deploy instead of V27 recommended auto-update model:
        KOMODO_STAGING_WEBHOOK_URL = Komodo staging stack webhook URL (in CREDENTIALS.md)
        KOMODO_PROD_WEBHOOK_URL    = Komodo prod stack webhook URL (in CREDENTIALS.md)
        KOMODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET      = Komodo webhook secret (in CREDENTIALS.md)
      Note: V27 recommended path uses Komodo auto-update (staging) + manual deploy (prod) — no webhooks needed.
      Location: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New secret

□ Docker Hub account ready (ONLY if docker.publish: true)
  - Human confirmed they have a hub.docker.com account
  - IF no account: instruct them to create one at hub.docker.com first (free plan is sufficient)
  - Docker Hub username confirmed and matches docker.hub_repo in inputs.yml
  - Image name is unique within their Docker Hub account — not a generic name like "app" or "web"
  - Image name format verified: lowercase, hyphens only (e.g. nucleus-erp, marine-guardian)
  - Full image reference locked: {docker.hub_repo} = DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME
  - Note: Docker Hub creates the repo automatically on first push — no manual creation needed

□ Image name uniqueness confirmed (CRITICAL — cannot be changed easily after deployment)
  - Image name is specific to THIS app — not shared with other apps in the same Docker Hub account
  - If human has multiple projects: each gets its own unique image name
    WRONG: app, web, erp, api (generic — collides with other projects)
    RIGHT: nucleus-erp, marine-guardian-enterprise, powerbyte-portal (specific + unique)
  - This name appears in every staging/prod server pull command — changing it requires
    updating all server env files and redeploy

IF docker.publish: true AND any of the above are unconfirmed:
  Output: "Before generating Phase 3 files, I need to confirm:
  1. Your Docker Hub username: ___
  2. Image name for this app (e.g. nucleus-erp): ___
  3. Do you already have a hub.docker.com account? [yes/no]
  Once confirmed I will lock these in inputs.yml and DECISIONS_LOG.md."
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Generate:
1. `inputs.yml` (version 3) — full app spec from PRODUCT.md + Phase 2 answers
   Includes `ports.dev.*` section with UNIQUE random port assignments for all services.
   Port generation algorithm: pick a random base integer in range 40000–49999 once per project.
   All service ports derive from that base using fixed offsets (Rule 22 Part A).
   This guarantees no two projects on the same machine ever share a port.
   Store base in inputs.yml as `ports.dev.base` so ports are reproducible.
2. `inputs.schema.json` — strict JSON Schema validation
3. No devcontainer files generated — WSL2 native is the only supported dev environment (Rule 8, V26).
4. **Environment files — one per deployment target. All real env files gitignored.**

   **Secret generation rules — applied strictly for every environment:**

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   CRITICAL — MANDATORY EXECUTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:
   You MUST use your terminal tool to run every openssl command below.
   DO NOT invent, generate, or hallucinate credential values.
   DO NOT substitute example values or copy values from this prompt.
   DO NOT reuse any value across dev, staging, and prod environments.
   Capture the ACTUAL stdout from the terminal. Use ONLY that output in env files.
   IF the terminal tool is unavailable: STOP. Write handoff. Do not proceed to env file generation.
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Use the following commands to generate each credential type. Run each command
   independently per environment — never reuse a value across dev/staging/prod.

   ```bash
   # 22-char password (DB, Redis, MinIO, PgBouncer, pgAdmin, SMTP)
   # Full printable ASCII — uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols
   # Result example: "kR7mN2pX9qL4wZ8vTr#5Yx"
   openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n' | head -c 22

   # 22-char username suffix for service accounts (hex — SQL-safe, no symbols)
   # DB_USER = ${app_slug}_ + 11-char hex = total ~22 chars, valid SQL identifier
   openssl rand -hex 11  # produces 22 lowercase hex chars e.g. "a3f8c1e92b04d7f6e301a8"

   # 48-char secret (AUTH_SECRET, JWT signing keys, webhook secrets)
   # Higher entropy required for cryptographic signing
   openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n' | head -c 48

   # Storage access key: hex prefix + 11-char hex suffix = 22 chars
   openssl rand -hex 11  # used as access key suffix after app_slug prefix
   ```

   **What gets generated for each field (ALL passwords minimum 22 characters):**
   - `DB_PASSWORD`              → 22-char full ASCII (per env, unique, never reused)
   - `DB_USER`                  → `${app_slug}_` + 11-char hex suffix (e.g. `myapp_a3f8c1e92b04`) — valid SQL identifier
   - `PGBOUNCER_AUTH_PASSWORD`  → 22-char full ASCII (different from DB_PASSWORD)
   - `REDIS_PASSWORD`           → 22-char full ASCII
   - `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`       → `${app_slug}-` + 11-char hex suffix (e.g. `myapp-a3f8c1e92b04d7f6e301`)
   - `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`       → 48-char
   - `PGADMIN_PASSWORD`         → 22-char full ASCII
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD`            → provided by human (external service — cannot be generated)
   - `AUTH_SECRET`              → 48-char base64 (Auth.js v5 JWT signing — higher entropy required)
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD`            → provided by human (external service — cannot be generated)
   - `PGADMIN_EMAIL` → `${app_slug}-` + 8-char hex suffix + `@admin.local` (e.g. `myapp-a3f8c1e9@admin.local`) — valid email format, unique per env
   - `PGADMIN_PASSWORD` → 22-char full ASCII (separate from DB password — never reuse)

   **Rule:** Generate ONCE per environment at Phase 3 time. Never regenerate unless explicitly
   requested — regenerating invalidates active sessions and running containers.
   Never reuse the same generated value across dev, staging, and prod.

   **`.env.example`** — the ONLY env file committed to git. Reference template for format only.

   Rules for `.env.example` content:
   - ALL generated secrets replaced with descriptive placeholders showing the EXPECTED FORMAT
   - Placeholder format: `your-<field-name>-here` — tells the reader what to put, not just "CHANGE_ME"
   - Host values show realistic example format (e.g. `localhost` for dev, `db.yourdomain.com` for remote)
   - Never contains any real password, secret, or access key — even from dev environment
   - Committed to git — safe to push to public or private repos
   - Updated whenever new env vars are added (e.g. during a Feature Update)
   - First line of .env.example must include this comment block so anyone cloning knows what to do:

   ```

4d. **`CREDENTIALS.md`** — master credentials reference file (NEW V17)

   Generated immediately after the 3 env files. Contains every username, password, secret,
   and hash for every backend service across all 3 environments in one readable table.
   Gives you a single place to look up any credential without opening multiple env files.

   **Format:**
   ```markdown
   # CREDENTIALS MASTER LIST
   # First written: Bootstrap Step 18 — Spec-Driven Platform V31
   # Updated when: Phase 3 regenerates env files (credentials rotate) or Feature Update rotates a secret
   # ⚠️  GITIGNORED — NEVER commit this file
   # ⚠️  NEVER paste into any AI chat, LLM, or log file
   # ⚠️  Treat like a password manager export — store securely offline
   # Last updated: [ISO timestamp]

   ## 🦎 Komodo (Deployment Manager)

   ## 📋 WHERE EACH FILE LIVES

   | File | Location | Committed to Git? |
   |------|----------|-------------------|
   | .env.dev | project root | ❌ NO — gitignored |
   | .env.staging | project root | ❌ NO — gitignored |
   | .env.prod | project root | ❌ NO — gitignored |
   | .env.example | project root | ✅ YES — safe template |
   | CREDENTIALS.md | project root | ❌ NO — gitignored |

   Anyone who clones this repo will only see .env.example with placeholder values.
   They must run Phase 3 (or fill .env.example manually) to regenerate their own credentials.
   ```

   **CREDENTIALS.md generation rules:**
   - All `<generated-*>` placeholders replaced with the actual generated values — not placeholders
   - Values are identical to what was written into the corresponding env files
   - File is generated once at Phase 3 time. Never auto-regenerated — only regenerated on explicit request
   - If any credential is rotated later (via Feature Update), the agent MUST update CREDENTIALS.md to match
   - IF docker.publish: true → add a GitHub Secrets section at the TOP of CREDENTIALS.md:
   ```
   ## ⚠ GITHUB SECRETS — ADD BEFORE FIRST PUSH TO MAIN
   Location: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

   Secret name         Value to paste
   ─────────────────── ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   DOCKERHUB_USERNAME  [your Docker Hub username, e.g. bonito]
   DOCKERHUB_TOKEN     [Docker Hub access token — NOT your password]

   How to get your Docker Hub access token:
   1. hub.docker.com → avatar → Account Settings → Security → New Access Token
   2. Name it: [app-name]-github-ci (e.g. nucleus-erp-github-ci)
   3. Copy immediately — shown only once
   4. Paste as DOCKERHUB_TOKEN value above

   Docker Hub image: ${docker.hub_repo}:latest
   GitHub Actions will push to this image on every merge to main.
   Without these secrets, docker-publish.yml will fail silently on first push.
   ```

   **`.gitignore` entries** — enforced in FOUR places (CREDENTIALS.md added everywhere):
   1. Bootstrap Step 1 writes the initial `.gitignore` with these entries
   2. Bootstrap Step 16 appends CREDENTIALS.md to `.gitignore`
   3. Phase 4 Part 1 appends/verifies all entries are present (idempotent check)
   4. `.clinerules` ENV FILE RULES section — agents check on every task start

   ```gitignore
   # Environment files — never commit real credentials
   .env
   .env.local
   .env.dev
   .env.staging
   .env.prod

   # Credentials master list — NEVER COMMIT THIS FILE
   CREDENTIALS.md

   # .env.example is intentionally NOT listed here — it is committed to git
   ```

   **ABSOLUTE HARD RULES — no exceptions:**
   - `CREDENTIALS.md` MUST be in `.gitignore` before Phase 3 writes it
   - If `CREDENTIALS.md` is ever found NOT in `.gitignore`: STOP immediately, add it, log 🔴 gotcha to lessons.md, then abort the current task and ask human to verify git status
   - NEVER include any credential value in CHANGELOG_AI.md, agent-log.md, lessons.md, or any governance doc
   - NEVER include CREDENTIALS.md content in any LLM context, tool call response, or log output
   - If `git status` shows CREDENTIALS.md as tracked: run `git rm --cached CREDENTIALS.md` immediately
   - CREDENTIALS.md is for human eyes only — agents write it, never read it back into context
   - Bootstrap Step 18 is a BLOCKING gate — CREDENTIALS.md must be fully written before Phase 2 begins (Phase 1 dev setup is optional)
   - All AI-generated service passwords must be minimum 22 characters — never shorter, never invented
   - Human-provided credentials (GitHub token, SMTP, Docker Hub token) must be collected from human at
     Step 18 — the AI never generates or guesses external account credentials

   **Volume naming rule:** Each environment gets its own Docker named volumes to guarantee
   complete data isolation. Naming pattern: `${app_slug}_${env}_${service}_data`
   Example: `myapp_dev_postgres_data`, `myapp_staging_postgres_data`, `myapp_prod_postgres_data`
   Volumes are declared in the compose files during Phase 4 Part 7.

5. `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` — every locked tech choice recorded, including port strategy, git strategy, and model routing
5b. `inputs.yml` git section:
    ```yaml
    git:
      default_branch: main
      branch_pattern: feat/{slug}
      commit_style: conventional
      squash_merge: true
      use_worktrees: true
    models:
      planning:   claude-code
      execution:  claude-sonnet-4-6
      governance: gemini-2.5-flash-lite
    ```
5c. `inputs.yml` docker section (UPDATED V22):
    Generated from Phase 2 Section I answers. If user did not specify, ask during Phase 2.
    ```yaml
    docker:
      publish: true                        # false = skip docker-publish.yml entirely
      registry: docker.io                  # docker.io | ghcr.io | custom
      hub_repo: yourdockerhubuser/appname  # Docker Hub username/repo — never hardcode
      image_name: appname                  # used as the image tag base
      platforms:
        - linux/amd64
        - linux/arm64
      build_on_push_to: main               # GitHub Actions auto-push: only from this branch
      dev_build: true                      # NEW V22: dev compose always rebuilds from source
    context7:
      enabled: true                        # NEW V23: Context7 MCP for live library docs (Rule 30)
      # No API key needed. Installed via .vscode/mcp.json in Bootstrap Step 10.
    accessibility:
      level: none                          # NEW V23: none | wcag_aa | wcag_aaa
      # wcag_aa: triggers a11y skill checklist in Phase 2.6 + Phase 7 delivery gate
      # Required for government/public sector apps (MGE uses wcag_aa)
    ```
    If `docker.publish: false` → Phase 4 Part 8 skips `docker-publish.yml` entirely.
    Hub repo and image name are locked in DECISIONS_LOG.md after Phase 3.
    `dev_build: true` → dev docker-compose.app.yml uses `build:` + `image:` (build then tag).
    `dev_build: false` → dev pulls pre-built image (advanced: CI-built image used locally).
5d. `inputs.yml` vibe_test section (NEW V19):
    Generated automatically. Default: enabled. Lock decision in DECISIONS_LOG.md.
    ```yaml
    vibe_test:
      enabled: true    # false = skip Phase 2.7 spec stress-test (not recommended)
    ```
    If `vibe_test.enabled: false` → Phase 2.7 skipped. Phase 3 proceeds without stress-test.
    Lock in DECISIONS_LOG.md: "Spec stress-test (Phase 2.7): enabled / disabled + reason"
6. If `design-system/MASTER.md` exists: add it to `.claude/settings.json` context file list
   (conditional — only if Phase 2.6 ran and created the file)
6.5. Generate `scripts/sync-credentials-to-env.sh` (NEW V30).
     This script reads CREDENTIALS.md and propagates human-filled values into .env.dev,
     .env.staging, .env.prod. Runs when human updates ⏳ placeholders after Bootstrap.

     Write scripts/sync-credentials-to-env.sh with EXACTLY this content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     # Sync CREDENTIALS.md values → .env.dev / .env.staging / .env.prod
     # Generated by Phase 3. Run after filling ⏳ placeholders in CREDENTIALS.md.
     # Safe to re-run — idempotent. Only writes values that are not still ⏳.

     set -euo pipefail
     CREDS="CREDENTIALS.md"

□ .env.dev, .env.staging, .env.prod all exist and contain no placeholder values
□ CREDENTIALS.md exists and is listed in .gitignore
□ scripts/sync-credentials-to-env.sh exists (V31 — propagates CREDENTIALS.md → env files)
□ docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md updated with port strategy, git strategy, model routing, docker publish decision
□ CHANGELOG_AI.md updated with Phase 3 entry (Agent: CLAUDE_CODE)
IF ANY item fails → Phase 3 = INCOMPLETE → fix before proceeding → do not hand off to Claude Code for Phase 4
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Output after completion:
> ✅ Phase 3 complete. Spec files generated.
> **Next: Phase 3.3 builds the interactive prototype, then Phase 3.5 generates the Execution Plan, then you start Phase 4.**

## PHASE 3.3 — INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPE & SIMULATION (NEW V32.6)
**Who:** Claude Code | **Where:** VS Code — Claude Code terminal
**Runs after:** Phase 3 (spec files exist) — **before** Phase 3.5 (execution plan).
**Trigger:** Auto-runs after the Phase 3 Output Contract passes. (Contrast Phase 2.8, which runs on

**Why this phase exists (the Orqafy lesson):** Spec completion ≠ a working app. Large builds have
discovered widespread wiring breakage (HTTP 500s, un-wired components) only at **Phase 8** — the
most expensive possible moment, because backend + UI + data layer are all built and every fix
ripples. Phase 3.3 pulls **behavior + wiring validation forward**, before scaffolding, so Phase 4
builds from a real, validated blueprint instead of building blind. *Build the scaffold from the
actual blueprint of the scaffolding — not by pointing at it.*

**Inputs:**
- `docs/PRODUCT.md` — source of truth, **read-only** (Rule 1). §3 Core User Flows drive the flow list.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` + `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` — PA static baseline. **INHERIT-not-REPLACE** (V32.5):
  designer-skills EXPANDS, never regenerates.
- `inputs.yml` + `inputs.schema.json` — Phase 3 output. Defines the **data shape to simulate**.

**Outputs:**
- `docs/PROTOTYPE.md` — the **durable behavioral blueprint**: every Core User Flow as a walkthrough,
  interaction/empty/loading/error states, the simulated-data model, and the **simulated→production
  swap boundary** per screen (what Phase 4 replaces with real tRPC/Prisma).
- `prototype/` — the **runnable** interactive prototype.
- Client sign-off → appended to `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` (Agent: CLAUDE_CODE), recording what was
  validated, deferred items, and any divergences. **Never PRODUCT.md** — Rule 1 keeps it human-only.

> Unlike the Phase 2.8 mockup (explicitly **ephemeral** — discarded once PRODUCT.md arrives), the
> Phase 3.3 prototype is **durable**: Phase 4 builds against it; Phase 5 regression-checks behavior
> against it.

**Simulation approach — project-defined ("our own way"), not locked to one technique:**

| App shape | Recommended simulated backend |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| CRUD-heavy | Browser storage (localStorage / IndexedDB) |
| Flow/workflow-heavy | In-memory mock service layer mirroring the schema |
| Read-mostly | Static fixtures |

**Non-negotiable contract:** whatever technique is chosen, the simulated layer **mirrors the Phase 3
schema shape** and lives behind a clear interface boundary, so Phase 4 swaps it for the real backend
without touching the UI.

**Steps:**
```
Step 1 — Flow inventory: Opus dispatches a Sonnet Scout to read PRODUCT.md §3 (R6 — non-allow-list, typically >100 lines) → Opus reviews the Scout's output to list every Core User Flow + the entities each touches (from the Phase 3 schema).
Step 2 — Choose the simulation technique per the table above; record the choice in docs/PROTOTYPE.md.
Step 3 — Design-system finalization (MOVED here from Phase 4 Parts 5-6 — V32.6). Four sub-actions, in order:
           3a. /design-tokens EXPAND docs/DESIGN.md (never regenerate — Rule 1)
           3b. COMPILE (V32.8 — Rule 31): run `npm run design:validate` (DTCG check) → `npm run design:build`
               (Style Dictionary v5, prefix:'sd') → emits `generated-tokens.css` (:root --sd-* vars) +
               `tokens.d.ts`. The hand-authored `globals.css` bridge aliases the three-layer chain:
               --sd-color-* → --primary → --color-primary. The default Tailwind palette is disabled by
               explicit enumeration (not the ignored `--color-*: initial` wildcard). Both files are
               generated — never hand-edited after this step.
           3c. build prototype screens from MOCKUP.jsx under prototype/, consuming ONLY compiled
               primitives from generated-tokens.css / tokens.d.ts (no raw hex, no off-palette [px]).
Step 4 — Build the simulated data layer mirroring inputs.schema.json behind one interface boundary.
Step 5 — Wire each screen to the simulated layer; make every Core User Flow walkable end-to-end with realistic data.
Step 6 — /design-review the prototype against the expanded tokens, THEN /design-refine ONLY flagged components (skip refine if no flags).
Step 7 — Write docs/PROTOTYPE.md (flows + states + simulated-data model + swap boundary per screen).
Step 8 — Client validation: present the running prototype; walk every flow; capture sign-off + deferrals to docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md. Then execute Step 8b (design baseline capture).
Step 8b — [BASELINE CAPTURE — DESIGN] Capture the signed-off prototype render as the DESIGN baseline:
           `npm run design:check -- --update-snapshots` in the prototype environment.
           Stored in tests/visual/snapshots/ with label "design-baseline".
           This baseline is referenced in Phase 5 / Phase 8 gate assertions.
           ⚠ ONLY runs AFTER client sign-off at Step 8 — do NOT run earlier in the sequence.
```

```
PHASE 3.3 GATE-CLOSURE — MANDATORY (V32.6 + V32.8)
Phase 3.3 cannot close — and Phase 3.5 MUST NOT begin — until ALL of these hold:
□ /design-review returns green (OR every flag resolved via /design-refine — no "soft pass")
□ the prototype covers EVERY Core User Flow in PRODUCT.md Section 3 (walkable end-to-end)
□ the CLIENT has signed off on the prototype, logged to docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md
□ docs/PROTOTYPE.md exists with the simulated→production swap boundary documented per screen
□ design:validate + design:build passed (generated-tokens.css + tokens.d.ts committed) (V32.8 — Rule 31)
□ DESIGN baseline captured via design:check --update-snapshots (tests/visual/snapshots/ committed) (V32.8 — Rule 31)
□ REGISTRY DONE-CLAIM (V32.8 — Rule 32): run acceptance contract check; scan LESSONS_REGISTRY.md for
  surface-relevant fingerprints; capture output into STATE.md evidence field {contract, check_command,
  captured_output} before claiming phase done. An empty evidence field = structurally malformed claim.
IF ANY item fails → Phase 3.3 = INCOMPLETE → resolve before proceeding to Phase 3.5
```

**MODEL HOOK (V32.6 + V32.8 — designer-skills + compiled tokens at Phase 3.3):** when `docs/DESIGN.md`
is present, Opus dispatches a Sonnet Scout to read it (≤200 lines direct, else Governance-Extraction per
R6/V32.3), then dispatches `/design-tokens` to **EXPAND-not-replace** the token table, runs
`design:validate` → `design:build` to emit `generated-tokens.css` + `tokens.d.ts` (three-layer bridge:
`--sd-color-* → --primary → --color-primary`; palette disabled by explicit enumeration), builds the
prototype screens consuming ONLY compiled primitives, then `/design-review` against `docs/MOCKUP.jsx`/
prototype, `/design-refine` only flagged components, then captures the DESIGN baseline after client
sign-off (Step 8b — post-sign-off only). PA's human-verified baseline stays authoritative (Rule 1) — designer-skills NEVER regenerate
DESIGN.md or MOCKUP.jsx from scratch. If DESIGN.md is absent (no PA Step 7), `/design-aesthetic` may be
invoked once to establish a baseline, then logged to PRODUCT.md Section 10 per Scenario 33. **Phase 4
Parts 5-6 no longer runs the full design-system pass — it runs a regression `/design-review` + re-captures
the PRODUCTION baseline** (see Phase 4).

**If skipped** (small app, no client validation needed): log "Phase 3.3 skipped — <reason>" to
`agent-log.md` and proceed to Phase 3.5. If a `prototype/` was still produced, the simulated→
production swap boundary applies at Phase 4.

Output after completion:
> ✅ Phase 3.3 complete. Interactive prototype validated and signed off (docs/PROTOTYPE.md + prototype/).
> **Next: Phase 3.5 generates the Execution Plan, then you start Phase 4.**

---

## PHASE 3.5 — EXECUTION PLAN GENERATION (AUTO — runs at end of Phase 3.3)
**Who:** Claude Code (auto-runs after Phase 3.3 gate-closure passes) | **Where:** VS Code — Claude Code terminal

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** This phase GENERATES the context budget plan for Phase 4+. Apply the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file) to this phase itself — Phase 3.5 reads the full PRODUCT.md to scan complexity, so if PRODUCT.md is very large (>30K tokens), read it in sections.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed. MODEL: ZERO OPUS EXECUTION (V32.3). Opus's only allowed actions: (a) READ context — but any non-allow-list file > 100 lines MUST go through Scout-Sonnet (R6); **V32.3:** allow-list governance docs > 200 lines also MUST go through Scout-Sonnet with the Governance Extraction Schema (`memory-governance.md §4`) — direct Opus read of a > 200-line allow-list governance doc counts as `opus_writes` for `dispatch_ratio` purposes; (b) plan, decompose, review Sonnet output — DONE acceptance requires full diff review, review-by-summary FORBIDDEN; (c) WRITE only the R8 Allow-List (docs/STATE.md · docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md · docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md · docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md · .cline/STATE.md). ALL other file writes (code, configs, tests) MUST be dispatched via Agent(subagent_type: "spec-executor") per §4 (fallback: Agent(model: "sonnet") when a task requires tools/MCPs outside spec-executor's allow-list). ≥ 2 independent dispatches MUST be parallel in ONE Opus response — serial only with a real data dependency (R7). Before each dispatch: run `wc -l`; total ≤ 500 lines per Sonnet task; files > 300 lines need explicit line ranges. Smart Checkpoint logs `dispatch_ratio` (sonnet_writes / opus_writes ≥ 3.0; < 1.0 triggers lessons.md drift review — R9). NO exceptions. NO "last resort." NO Opus executor escalation. If about to Edit/Write a non-allow-list file, STOP and dispatch.

**Purpose:** Analyze PRODUCT.md complexity and predict context cost per task BEFORE
Phase 4 starts. Generates a pre-computed execution plan that right-sizes every session
to stay well within context limits. Prevention, not reaction.

**Philosophy:** Many small sessions that complete cleanly with confidence are infinitely
better than fewer large sessions that thrash and produce broken code. Extra sessions
cost minutes. Thrashing costs hours of debugging and rework.

**Trigger:** Runs automatically at the end of Phase 3 — no human prompt needed.

### Step 1 — PRODUCT.md Complexity Scan

Scan the entire PRODUCT.md and build a complexity profile:
```
METRICS:
  entities:        [count all entities in Data Entities section]
  modules:         [count all ### Module headings in Modules + Features]
  pages:           [count all declared pages/screens]
  trpc_routers:    [estimate: 1 per module + shared utilities]
  bullmq_queues:   [count all background job declarations]
  integrations:    [count external services: payment, email, SMS, n8n, OpenClaw]
  mobile_first:    [count pages marked "Mobile First" in Mobile Needs]
  mobile_ready:    [count pages marked "Mobile Ready"]
  cross_module:    [count entities referenced by 3+ modules — high coupling]

MODULE BREAKDOWN (per module):
  [ModuleName]:
    entities: [N]
    pages: [N]
    has_complex_logic: [yes/no — financial calculations, state machines, approval flows]
    depends_on: [list of other modules this module imports from]
    estimated_files: [N]
```

### Step 2 — Context Cost Estimation

For each task that Claude Code will perform, estimate the context cost:

```
CONTEXT BUDGET per session: 120K tokens (safe ceiling — leaves 80K buffer in 200K window)

COST ESTIMATION FORMULA per sub-session:
  read_cost:
    + STATE.md + execution-plan.md          ~2K tokens (always loaded)
    + governance docs (lessons.md, etc.)     ~5K tokens (always loaded)
    + PRODUCT.md section for this module     ~[lines × 4] tokens
    + Prisma models for this module          ~[entity_count × 200] tokens
    + Existing files to read as reference    ~[file_count × 300] tokens
  write_cost:
    + New files to generate                  ~[file_count × 500] tokens
    + Test files                             ~[test_count × 400] tokens
  tool_cost:
    + Terminal commands (lint, typecheck)     ~3K tokens per run
    + Git operations                         ~1K tokens
  conversation_cost:
    + Agent reasoning + error correction     ~15K tokens overhead

  TOTAL ESTIMATED = read_cost + write_cost + tool_cost + conversation_cost

  IF TOTAL ESTIMATED > 100K → SPLIT FURTHER (must subdivide this sub-session)
  IF TOTAL ESTIMATED > 80K  → AT RISK (flag as "tight" — may need mid-session /clear)
  IF TOTAL ESTIMATED ≤ 80K  → SAFE (comfortable margin)
```

### Step 3 — Task Decomposition

Decompose ALL Phase 4 work into granular tasks, then group into sessions:

```
TASK TYPES (each is one atomic unit of work):
  SCHEMA:     Define Prisma models for [N] entities → generates schema.prisma sections
  ROUTER:     Build tRPC router for [Module] → router file + input validators
  SERVICE:    Build business logic for [Module] → service files (if complex logic)
  UI_LAYOUT:  Build app shell → layout, sidebar, header, footer, theme provider
  UI_MODULE:  Build all pages for [Module] → list, detail, create, edit pages
  UI_SHARED:  Build shared components → DataTable, forms, modals, filters
  JOBS:       Build BullMQ workers for [queue list]
  MOBILE_FDN: Expo scaffold + navigation + auth + theme
  MOBILE_DB:  WatermelonDB schema + sync engine
  MOBILE_MOD: Build mobile screens for [Module] (Mobile First only)
  INFRA:      Docker compose, CI, deploy scripts
  GOVERNANCE: MANIFEST.txt, SocratiCode index, final governance sweep

GROUPING RULES:
  1. Each session gets tasks totaling ≤80K estimated context (SAFE zone)
  2. Never mix ROUTER + UI_MODULE in the same session (different mental context)
  3. Schema tasks can be grouped — they're read-heavy but write-light
  4. Complex logic modules (financial calculations, state machines) get their
     own session — never grouped with other modules
  5. Modules with high cross_module coupling: build the dependency first
  6. UI_SHARED must come before any UI_MODULE sessions
  7. MOBILE_FDN → MOBILE_DB → MOBILE_MOD (strict order, never parallel)
```

### Step 4 — Dependency Ordering

Order all sessions respecting dependencies:
```
HARD DEPENDENCIES (must follow this order):
  Part 1 (config)       → before everything
  Part 2 (shared/api)   → before routers
  SCHEMA tasks          → before ROUTER tasks
  ROUTER tasks          → before UI_MODULE tasks
  UI_SHARED             → before UI_MODULE tasks
  UI_LAYOUT             → before UI_MODULE tasks
  All web UI            → before INFRA (compose needs to know ports/services)
  MOBILE_FDN            → MOBILE_DB → MOBILE_MOD
  Everything            → before GOVERNANCE (final sweep)

SOFT DEPENDENCIES (recommended but not blocking):
  Core modules (the primary workflow) → before secondary modules
  Simple modules → before complex modules (build momentum, catch patterns early)
  Modules with fewer dependencies → before highly coupled modules
```

### Step 5 — Write Execution Plan

Write `.cline/tasks/execution-plan.md` with this format:
```markdown
# Phase 4 Execution Plan — [AppName]
Generated: [timestamp]

## Complexity Profile
| Metric | Count | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Entities | [N] | [SMALL ≤15 / MEDIUM 16-40 / LARGE 41+] |
| Modules | [N] | [SMALL ≤8 / MEDIUM 9-15 / LARGE 16+] |
| Pages | [N] | [SMALL ≤30 / MEDIUM 31-60 / LARGE 61+] |
| BullMQ Queues | [N] | |

| **Overall** | | **[SMALL / MEDIUM / LARGE / ENTERPRISE]** |

## Session Schedule

### Part 1 — Root config
| Session | Tasks | Est. Files | Est. Context | Risk |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Root config (standard) | 6 | ~25K | ✅ SAFE |

### Part 2 — Shared packages
| Session | Tasks | Est. Files | Est. Context | Risk |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 2 | shared + api-client | 8 | ~30K | ✅ SAFE |

### Part 3 — Database + tRPC routers

| 8c | Push notifications | [N] | ~[N]K | [risk] |
| 8d | MOBILE_MOD: [ModuleA] screens | [N] | ~[N]K | [risk] |

## Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total sessions | [N] |
| Sessions marked SAFE (≤80K) | [N] |
| Sessions marked AT RISK (80-100K) | [N] |
| Sessions marked MUST SPLIT (>100K) | [should be 0 — if not, re-split] |
| Estimated total build time | [N sessions × ~45 min avg] |

## Read Rules per Session
Each session MUST follow these read constraints:
- Read ONLY the PRODUCT.md sections listed in the session's task assignment
- Read ONLY the Prisma models for entities in the current module
- Read ONLY existing files that the current task directly imports from
- Do NOT scan directories — read specific files by path
- Do NOT read files from modules not assigned to this session
```

### Step 6 — Skill Activation Plan

Based on the complexity profile and task decomposition, recommend which Claude Code
skills to activate for each phase. Skills give Claude Code domain-specific expertise
that improves planning accuracy and code quality per session.

**Skill source:** Powerbyte AI Engineering Framework SPA — clone the framework repo and run `npm run dev` to browse the 600+ skill catalog locally (full library surfaced via `/scan-project`).
**Prompt reference:** `specdrivenprompt/Prompt_References.html` in the framework repo, or run `npm run docs:up` for the offline Docker docs hub.

**Installation workflow (at each phase transition):**
1. Run `/scan-project` in Claude Code — let it run all 5 phases (scan → match →
   conflict detection → install commands → interactive approval). Do NOT interfere.
2. AFTER `/scan-project` finishes and you approve its recommendations, check the
   framework's required skill list below. If any required skill was NOT installed
   by `/scan-project`, install it manually.
3. Run `check for skill conflicts` to verify no conflicts exist.
4. Report to the human: "Skills active: [list]. Framework additions: [list of any
   skills added in step 2 that /scan-project didn't suggest]."

**Session discipline (from Skill Installer ecosystem):**
- Start every session with: `catch me up` or `resume session` — loads full context
  from memory, checks git log, summarizes current state
- End every session with: `save session` — distills everything into memory files
  (code changes, decisions, patterns, dev history). Run BEFORE closing.
- These replace our custom pause/resume prompts for projects with the Skill Installer active.
  For projects WITHOUT the Skill Installer, use the original pause/resume from prompt 2.10.

**CRITICAL — Bundle inheritance (do NOT install these separately):**
- `superpowers` bundle INCLUDES: systematic-debugging, root-cause-tracing, TDD,
  brainstorming, verification, git-worktrees, finishing-branch, parallel-agents,
  code-review requesting/receiving. Do NOT install these individually.
- `code-review-graph` bundle INCLUDES: debug-issue, explore-codebase, refactor-safely.
- `claude-skills-65` INCLUDES: individual framework skills (react-expert, nestjs-expert, etc.)

**CRITICAL — Conflict registry (verified conflict-free):**
- `socraticode` (our MCP server) + `code-review-graph` (Primary Group) = VALID
  because SocratiCode runs as MCP-only alongside code-review-graph as active skill.
- All skills below are checked against the Pairwise Conflict and Mutual Exclusion
  registries — no conflicts.

**Phase 3.5 generates this schedule in the execution plan. Claude Code follows it.**

```markdown
## Skill Activation Schedule

### Primary Group (6 always-on slots — install ONCE, active across all phases)

Run in Claude Code:
  /scan-project

The Skill Installer's Skillpilot will auto-detect your project type (Solo Full-Stack)
and suggest the Primary Group. Let it install, then verify these 6 slots are filled:

| Slot | Skill | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | superpowers | Foundational toolkit — TDD, debugging, brainstorming, git, parallel agents (replaces 8 skills) |
| 2 | code-review-graph | Codebase awareness — SQLite knowledge graph, blast radius, 28 MCP tools |
| 3 | planning-with-files | Strategic thinking — persistent plans that survive sessions (ideal for execution-plan.md) |
| 4 | frontend-design + design-auditor + owasp-security | Frontend intelligence — design + validate + secure in one pass |
| 5 | git-pushing | Workflow — commit discipline, push safety, context preservation |
| 6 | claude-skills-65 | Multi-framework (optional) — 65 skills for 30+ frameworks |

These cover the majority of what every phase needs. The per-phase additions below
are supplementary skills beyond the Primary Group.

### Phase 4 Part 3 (schema + tRPC routers) — verify before first Part 3 session

Run: /scan-project (re-scan — codebase has changed since bootstrap)

Verify these supplementary skills are also active:

| Skill | Layer | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| postgres | Database | Read-only DB queries — verify schema after migration, inspect seed data |

Note: owasp-security is already in Primary Group Slot 4.
Note: TDD enforcement is already in superpowers (Slot 1).

### Phase 4 Parts 5-6 (Web UI) — verify before first Part 5 session

Run: /scan-project (re-scan — routers are now built)

Verify these supplementary skills are also active:

| Skill | Layer | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| oiloil-ui-ux-guide | UX guidance | Task-first UX, HCI laws, interaction psychology |
| playwright-skill | Testing | E2E + component + visual + a11y testing per module |
| react-doctor | React diagnostics | Catch React anti-patterns (state/effects, perf, a11y, bundle size) before UI delivery — `npx react-doctor@latest`; install via `npx react-doctor@latest install` |
| designer-skills | Design system (V32.5 · finalized at Phase 3.3 since V32.6) | The full design-system pass (`/design-tokens` EXPAND, `/design-review`, `/design-refine`) now runs at **Phase 3.3**, not here. At Parts 5-6, designer-skills runs a **regression `/design-review` only** — confirming that wiring the validated prototype to the production backend did not break the finalized visuals. Bundle: `julianoczkowski/designer-skills` (8 children) |

**MODEL HOOK (V32.6 + V32.8 — Phase 4 Parts 5-6 = WIRE + REGRESSION + PRODUCTION BASELINE):** Parts 5-6 no longer establishes the design system — that was locked at Phase 3.3 (`docs/PROTOTYPE.md` + expanded `docs/DESIGN.md`). Here, Opus dispatches Sonnet to **wire the validated prototype's screens to the production tRPC/Prisma backend**, swapping the Phase 3.3 simulated data layer for the real one **behind the same interface boundary** — the UI/component structure from the prototype is INHERITED, not redesigned. Every screen is built ONLY from compiled primitives in `generated-tokens.css` / `tokens.d.ts` — no raw hex values, no off-palette `[px]` utilities, and no Tailwind default-palette utilities (palette disabled by explicit enumeration per Rule 31). After wiring, dispatch a **regression `/design-review`** against `docs/MOCKUP.jsx`/the finalized tokens; `/design-refine` ONLY components the wiring visibly regressed. Then: **re-capture the PRODUCTION baseline** against a deterministic fixture state (`tests/visual/fixtures/` — seeded DB snapshot or MSW-mocked responses): run `npm run design:check -- --update-snapshots` in the fixture-seeded state; commit resulting snapshots as the production baseline that Phase 5 / Phase 8 assert against. Token assertions use `getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor` in `rgb()` form (not raw CSS-var values). PA's human-verified baseline + the Phase 3.3 finalized tokens stay authoritative (Rule 1) — never regenerate. If no `prototype/` exists (Phase 3.3 was skipped), fall back to the V32.5 behavior: run the full design-system pass here against the scaffolded components, then capture the production baseline. ```
PHASE 4 PARTS 5-6 GATE-CLOSURE — MANDATORY (V32.5.1 + V32.8)
Parts 5-6 cannot close — and Part 7 MUST NOT begin — until ALL of these hold:
□ tokens-only build: every screen built ONLY from compiled primitives in generated-tokens.css /
  tokens.d.ts (no raw hex, no off-palette [px], no Tailwind default-palette utilities)
□ production baseline captured + committed: `design:check --update-snapshots` run against
  deterministic fixture state (tests/visual/fixtures/); snapshots committed to repo
□ design:check green: regression `/design-review` returns green (every wiring-introduced flag
  resolved via `/design-refine` — no "soft pass")
□ registry done-claim: LESSONS_REGISTRY.md scanned for surface-relevant fingerprints; check
  output captured into STATE.md {contract, check_command, captured_output} — empty field =
  structurally malformed claim
IF ANY item fails → Parts 5-6 = INCOMPLETE → resolve before Part 7 (background jobs) begins
```

Note: design-auditor and frontend-design are already in Primary Group Slot 4.
Note: react-doctor is a supplementary diagnostic (NOT a Primary Group slot) — /scan-project recommends it on a React signal after a read-only audit, installs only on approval.
Note: designer-skills is a supplementary bundle (NOT a Primary Group slot) — /scan-project installs via approval gate on a frontend+styling signal; commands route INHERIT-not-REPLACE over PA artifacts (V32.5).
Note: vercel-agent-skills may be suggested by /scan-project for Next.js projects — accept it.

### Phase 4 Part 7 (Docker + infrastructure) — conditional

| Skill | Layer | Why | When |
|-------|-------|-----|------|
| aws-skills | Infrastructure | CDK best practices, cost optimization | Only if AWS deployment declared |

### Phase 5 (Validation) — verify before starting Phase 5

Run: /scan-project (re-scan — full app is now built)

Verify this supplementary skill is active:

| Skill | Layer | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| test-fixing | Testing | Smart error grouping — systematic repair of all failing tests |
| react-doctor | React diagnostics | Audit React for correctness/perf/a11y/bundle issues during validation — `npx react-doctor@latest` |

**Dev-time profiling (always available — "which execution eats CPU/RAM?", see templates.md Rule 5b.0):**

| Tool | Layer | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Chrome DevTools + `--inspect` | Profiling | `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' pnpm dev` → `chrome://inspect` → Performance monitor (realtime CPU/heap graph) + flamechart (names the hot function) |
| clinic.js | Profiling | `clinic doctor`/`clinic flame` for recorded CPU/mem/event-loop reports |
| Prisma query log | DB profiling | `log:['query']` (dev) surfaces N+1 / slow queries — the usual server CPU+latency culprit |

This is the DEV answer for "is my app heavy and what's causing it." Netdata (Phase 6) is the
PRODUCTION answer (infra health) — it cannot name the responsible function/query. Different layers.

**Target-gated extended testing (tools, not skills — see templates.md Rule 5b):**

| Tool | Gate | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| k6 (load test) | `PRODUCT.md` §10 declares throughput/latency targets OR a public API | `docker-compose.loadtest.yml` — thresholds map to exit code = Phase-5 pass/fail gate (Rule 5b.2) |
| Maestro (mobile E2E) | `PRODUCT.md` §9 declares native mobile (Expo) | One YAML flow per core user flow; `maestro test --format junit`. Complement: catalogued `midscene-skills` for vision-driven exploratory checks (Rule 5b.3) |

These are CLI/Docker tools driven by templates — NOT installable via `/scan-project`/SKILLS_DB.
Activate only on the deployment-target signal above; otherwise skip.

Note: systematic-debugging is already in superpowers (Slot 1).

### Phase 6 + 6.5 (Docker + Visual QA + Error Triage)

| Skill | Layer | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| postgres | Database | Query live DB to verify migrations, seeds, data integrity |

**Production infra monitoring is OUT OF SCOPE** (see templates.md Rule 5b.1) — the separate
Server-Setups framework owns server health/dashboards/alerting for the deployed host. Do NOT
scaffold a monitoring service into the app's `deploy/compose/`. For dev-time "is my app heavy /
what's the culprit," use Phase 5 / Rule 5b.0 profiling.

Note: debug-issue and root-cause-tracing are already in superpowers (Slot 1) and
code-review-graph (Slot 2). Do NOT install debug-skill separately — it conflicts
with the superpowers bundle.

### Phase 7 (Feature Updates) — all previous skills remain active, add:

| Skill | Layer | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| review-implementing | Code review | Systematic code review feedback implementation |
| react-doctor | React diagnostics | Diagnose React issues introduced by a feature before delivery — `npx react-doctor@latest` |
| designer-skills | Design system (V32.5) | On UI-touching feature updates: `/design-review` audits the delta against existing `docs/DESIGN.md`; `/design-refine` only if regressions surface. INHERIT-not-REPLACE — never re-derives the baseline |

**MODEL HOOK (V32.5 — designer-skills, Phase 7 UI-delta):** when a Feature Update touches UI files (Web Parts 5-6 surfaces), Opus dispatches `/design-review` over the changed components against `docs/DESIGN.md`. If `/design-review` flags regressions vs the baseline tokens/aesthetic, dispatch `/design-refine` ONLY on the flagged components — never sweep the whole UI. If the Feature Update introduces an explicit aesthetic change (PRODUCT.md Section 10 amendment), update `docs/DESIGN.md` via `/design-tokens` EXPAND mode and log the diff to CHANGELOG_AI.md per Rule 15. **Gate-closure (V32.5.1):** A UI-touching Feature Update cannot be marked DONE until `/design-review` returns green against the delta. Unresolved regressions MUST be resolved via `/design-refine` (surgical, flagged-only) OR the offending changes MUST be reverted. CHANGELOG_AI.md MUST record the gate verdict (`design-review: green` or `design-review: green-after-refine`) per Rule 15.

Note: code-review requesting/receiving is already in superpowers (Slot 1).
Note: blast radius analysis is already in code-review-graph (Slot 2).
Note: designer-skills INHERIT-not-REPLACE — `docs/DESIGN.md` is the human-verified baseline (PA Step 7 or earlier Phase 4); designer-skills sharpen, they never regenerate (V32.5).
```

**Skill activation rules:**
- `/scan-project` runs FIRST at each phase transition — let it do its full 5-phase
  analysis and install whatever it recommends without interference
- AFTER `/scan-project` finishes, check the framework's required list above and
  install any missing supplementary skills manually
- Run `check for skill conflicts` after any manual installation
- Skills persist across sessions once installed — no need to reinstall per sub-session
- `/scan-project` may install additional skills beyond the framework's list — that's
  fine, more context = better decisions for Claude Code
- If `/scan-project` suggests removing a skill from the framework's required list,
  keep the framework's skill — it supplements, the framework decides the minimum
- Use `what skills are active?` at any time to verify the current skill profile
- Use `optimize my skill set` if sessions feel sluggish — may suggest MCP-only
  conversions to reduce token overhead

### Step 7 — Human Review

Output:
```
📋 Phase 4 Execution Plan generated → .cline/tasks/execution-plan.md

COMPLEXITY: [SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE/ENTERPRISE]
  [X] entities · [Y] modules · [Z] pages

SESSION SCHEDULE:
  Part 1:  1 session  (standard)
  Part 2:  1 session  (standard)
  Part 3:  [N] sessions (schema + routers, split by module)
  Part 5:  [N] sessions (web UI, split by module)
  Part 7:  1 session  (standard)
  Part 8:  [N] sessions (mobile, split by layer + module)
  ─────────────────────
  TOTAL:   [N] sessions

CONTEXT SAFETY:
  ✅ SAFE:     [N] sessions
  ⚠  AT RISK:  [N] sessions (flagged — may need mid-session adjustment)
  🔴 MUST SPLIT: [should be 0]

Review the plan. Then say "Start Part 1" to begin Phase 4.
Options:
  • "Start Part 1" — accept and begin
  • "Split [session] further" — subdivide a specific session
  • "Combine [sessionA] and [sessionB]" — merge if you think they're small enough
  • "Show me [Part N] details" — see the full task list for a specific Part
```

### Phase 3.5 Output Contract
```
□ .cline/tasks/execution-plan.md exists with full session schedule
□ Every session estimates ≤80K context (SAFE) — no session exceeds 100K
□ Complex-logic modules have their own dedicated sessions
□ Part 8 (Mobile) is ALWAYS sub-divided if mobile is declared
□ Dependency ordering is respected (schema → routers → UI → infra)
□ Read rules are specified per session (which PRODUCT.md sections, which files)
□ Skill activation schedule is included with Required/Recommended/Conditional ratings
□ All "Required" pre-build skills are installed before Phase 4 begins
□ Human has reviewed and approved (or adjusted) the plan
□ STATE.md updated: PHASE="Phase 3.5 complete — Execution Plan ready"
```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

> **Open Claude Code and say "Start Phase 4". Claude Code reads execution-plan.md and runs the first session. After each session: STOP. Human opens next session.**

---

## PHASE 4 — FULL MONOREPO SCAFFOLD
**Who:** Claude Code (Part-by-Part, fresh session each Part — Rule 24 · Cline deprecated) | **Where:** VS Code — Claude Code terminal

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file) at the START of every Part. Estimate files + tokens. If >12 files or >80K tokens, sub-divide by module per the anti-thrashing rule below. The execution plan from Phase 3.5 pre-computes this — follow it.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE** (memory-governance.md): PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1) per Part. POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) after each Part. MODEL: ZERO OPUS EXECUTION (V32.3). Opus's only allowed actions: (a) READ context — but any non-allow-list file > 100 lines MUST go through Scout-Sonnet (R6); **V32.3:** allow-list governance docs > 200 lines also MUST go through Scout-Sonnet with the Governance Extraction Schema (`memory-governance.md §4`) — direct Opus read of a > 200-line allow-list governance doc counts as `opus_writes` for `dispatch_ratio` purposes; (b) plan, decompose, review Sonnet output — DONE acceptance requires full diff review, review-by-summary FORBIDDEN; (c) WRITE only the R8 Allow-List (docs/STATE.md · docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md · docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md · docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md · .cline/STATE.md). ALL other file writes (code, configs, tests) MUST be dispatched via Agent(subagent_type: "spec-executor") per §4 (fallback: Agent(model: "sonnet") when a task requires tools/MCPs outside spec-executor's allow-list). ≥ 2 independent dispatches MUST be parallel in ONE Opus response — serial only with a real data dependency (R7). Before each dispatch: run `wc -l`; total ≤ 500 lines per Sonnet task; files > 300 lines need explicit line ranges. Smart Checkpoint logs `dispatch_ratio` (sonnet_writes / opus_writes ≥ 3.0; < 1.0 triggers lessons.md drift review — R9). NO exceptions. NO "last resort." NO Opus executor escalation. If about to Edit/Write a non-allow-list file, STOP and dispatch.

Each Part runs in a FRESH Claude Code session (Rule 24 — prevents context accumulation).
Each Part stays under ~3,000 lines of context for best reliability.
Each Part: reads STATE.md first → reads `.cline/tasks/execution-plan.md` for sub-division assignments → branches → builds → validates → squash-merges → STOPS.

**IMPORTANT:** If `.cline/tasks/execution-plan.md` exists and shows sub-divisions for
the current Part, follow the sub-division plan. Build ONLY the modules assigned to this
sub-session. Do NOT build the entire Part in one session if the plan says to split it.

**SKILL CHECK:** At the start of each phase transition (Part 3, Part 5, Phase 5, Phase 6),
run `/scan-project` in Claude Code to verify skills are current. Check the Skill Activation
Schedule in `.cline/tasks/execution-plan.md` for the minimum required set. Skills persist
across sessions once installed — no need to reinstall per sub-session.

### ⚠ ANTI-THRASHING RULE — MANDATORY (applies to ALL Parts)

**Model context:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Claude Code. 200K token context window,
~120K practical working budget, ≤80K SAFE zone for input context. Every file read,
governance doc loaded, and PRODUCT.md section parsed consumes from this budget.
The 12-file threshold is calibrated for this model: each file + overhead averages
~6-8K tokens, so 12 files ≈ 80-96K ≈ the edge of the SAFE zone.

**Problem:** On large apps (15+ entities, 10+ modules), Parts 3-6 and Part 8 can trigger
"Autocompact is thrashing" — the context window fills within 3 turns because Claude Code
tries to read the entire PRODUCT.md + entire codebase at once.

**Rule:** At the START of every Part, BEFORE writing any code, Claude Code MUST:

1. Count the number of modules/entities relevant to this Part from PRODUCT.md
2. Estimate the token cost: CLAUDE.md (~5K) + active rules file (~3K) + PRODUCT.md
   sections (~2-4K each) + existing source files to read (~1-3K each) + governance
   docs (~10-15K) + output generation (~2-5K per file). If total exceeds 80K → MUST split.
3. IF the Part scope exceeds 12 files to create/modify OR estimated context exceeds
   80K tokens → the Part MUST be sub-divided into module-by-module sessions.
   Do NOT attempt to build everything in one session.
4. Report the sub-division plan to the human:
   ```
   ⚠ Part [N] scope assessment: [X] modules, ~[Y] files, ~[Z]K estimated tokens.
   Exceeds 80K SAFE zone. Splitting into sub-sessions:
     Part [N]a — [ModuleName]: [list of files] (~[N]K tokens)
     Part [N]b — [ModuleName]: [list of files] (~[N]K tokens)
     ...
   Starting with Part [N]a. I'll commit and stop after each sub-session.
   ```
5. IF the Part scope is ≤12 files AND estimated context is ≤80K → proceed normally.
6. The human may also FORCE sub-division at any time by saying:
   "Split this Part by module" — even if the threshold is not reached.

**Per sub-session rules (when sub-divided):**
- Read ONLY the PRODUCT.md sections for the current module — do NOT read the entire file
  (a full PRODUCT.md can be 20-40K tokens alone — reading it all defeats the purpose)
- Read ONLY the files relevant to the current module (routers, models, pages)
- Use codebase_search (Rule 17) to find specific symbols instead of opening files for context
- If you need a shared component or utility, read ONLY that single file — not the directory
- Build all files for this module, then run tests for this module
- Commit with message: "feat([part-scope]): [ModuleName] [what was built]"
- Update STATE.md with "Phase 4 Part [N] — [ModuleName] DONE, [remaining modules list]"
- STOP. Do NOT start the next module. Human opens a new session.

**Part 8 (Mobile) special handling:** Part 8 MUST ALWAYS be sub-divided regardless of
entity count, because it involves platform setup (Expo scaffold, WatermelonDB, push
notifications) plus per-module screen builds. Sub-divide as:
- 8a: Expo project scaffold + navigation + auth flow + theme provider
- 8b: WatermelonDB schema + sync engine + conflict resolution
- 8c: Push notification setup (Expo Push)
- 8d onward: One "Mobile First" module per session (skip "Mobile Ready" pages — 
  those are handled by responsive web in Parts 5-6)

**If thrashing occurs mid-session despite sub-division:**
1. Immediately run `/clear` to reset context
2. Update STATE.md with exact progress (which files done, which pending)
3. Write a handoff note to `.cline/handoffs/`
4. Commit all work done so far
5. STOP — human opens a new session with narrower scope

This rule exists because: many small commits that complete cleanly are infinitely better
than one large session that thrashes and produces broken or incomplete code.

---

Trigger: Open `.cline/tasks/phase4-part1.md` in a new Claude Code session → say "Start Part 1"
(Note: `.cline/tasks/` directory name preserved for historical continuity — Claude Code reads these task files.)
After Part 1 completes: open `phase4-part2.md` in a NEW Claude Code session → say "Start Part 2"
Continue until Part 8 completes. Then say "Start Phase 5" in a new Claude Code session.

Claude Code derives everything from `inputs.yml` — never hardcodes.

### PART 1 — Root config files

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — workspace package globs
- `turbo.json` — pipelines: lint, typecheck, test, build (with dependsOn)
- root `package.json` — root scripts delegating to turbo
- `tsconfig.base.json` — root TypeScript base config:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
      "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
      "noImplicitReturns": true,
      "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    }
  }
  ```
- `.editorconfig` — consistent formatting across all editors
- `.prettierrc` — code formatting (singleQuote, semi, tabWidth: 2)
- `.eslintrc.js` — base ESLint with TypeScript rules:
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error`
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment: error`
  - `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions: error`
- `.gitignore` — final version (replaces Phase 0 bootstrap)
- `.nvmrc` — Node version pin

### PART 2 — packages/shared + packages/api-client
- `packages/shared/src/types/` — TypeScript interfaces for every entity
- `packages/shared/src/schemas/` — Zod schemas for all entities
- `packages/api-client/` — typed tRPC client or fetch wrappers
  (used by all apps — never by packages/db or workers)

### PART 3 — packages/db

Full ORM schema with ALL entities from PRODUCT.md (typed, relations included).
Initial migration files (up + down). Typed query helpers / repository layer per entity.
Seed script for dev data. `package.json` with exports field.
`tsconfig.json` extending `../../tsconfig.base.json`.

**Always generate — regardless of tenancy mode (Rule 7B):**

- `src/audit.ts` — AuditLog write helper (L5 — always active):
  ```ts
  // Immutable audit record on every mutation — active in single AND multi mode
  export async function writeAuditLog(tx, {
    tenantId, userId, action, entity, entityId, before, after
  }: AuditLogEntry): Promise<void>
  ```

- `src/middleware/tenant-guard.ts` — Prisma query guardrails (L6 — always active):
  ```ts
  // L6 — Prisma extension that auto-injects tenantId into EVERY query operation.
  // CRITICAL: uses $allOperations to cover findMany, findFirst, findUnique, create,
  // createMany, update, updateMany, delete, deleteMany, count, aggregate, groupBy.
  // DO NOT replace $allOperations with a list of individual methods — any unlisted
  // method becomes an unguarded tenant bypass.
  export const tenantGuardExtension = Prisma.defineExtension({
    query: {
      $allModels: {
        async $allOperations({ args, query, model, operation }) {
          // Skip system tables that are not tenant-scoped
          if (['AuditLog', 'Tenant'].includes(model)) return query(args);
          // Inject tenantId into where clause for reads and writes
          if ('where' in args) {
            args.where = { ...args.where, tenantId: currentTenantId() };
          }
          if ('data' in args && !Array.isArray(args.data)) {
            args.data = { ...args.data, tenantId: currentTenantId() };
          }
          return query(args);
        },
      }
    }
  });
  ```

- `AuditLog` Prisma model — always in schema:
  ```prisma
  model AuditLog {
    id        String   @id @default(cuid())
    tenantId  String?  @map("tenant_id")
    userId    String   @map("user_id")
    action    String   // CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE
    entity    String   // table name
    entityId  String   @map("entity_id")
    before    Json?
    after     Json?
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())

    @@index([tenantId])
    @@index([userId])
    @@index([entity, entityId])
  }
  ```

**Additionally if `tenancy.mode: multi` — (Rule 7 L2):**

- `src/rls.ts` — PostgreSQL RLS helper:
  ```ts
  export async function withTenant<T>(
    tenantId: string,
    fn: (tx: Prisma.TransactionClient) => Promise<T>
  ): Promise<T> {
    return prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
      await tx.$executeRaw`SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant_id', ${tenantId}, true)`;
      return fn(tx);
    });
  }
  ```
- RLS migration (active, not commented):
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE "Entity" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON "Entity"
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);
  ```

**If `tenancy.mode: single` — write RLS as SQL comments for future upgrade:**
  ```sql
  -- RLS policy scaffolded but NOT enabled — uncomment on upgrade to multi:
  -- ALTER TABLE "Entity" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  -- CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON "Entity"
  --   USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);
  ```

### PART 4 — packages/ui + packages/jobs + packages/storage
- `packages/ui/` — shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Radix UI (web); React Native Reusables + NativeWind (mobile if declared)
- `packages/jobs/` — ONLY if jobs.enabled. Valkey (MIT Redis fork) + BullMQ typed queues, workers, DLQ.
- `packages/storage/` — ONLY if storage.enabled. Typed MinIO/S3/R2 wrapper.

### PART 5 — apps/[web app] (Next.js full scaffold)

**FIRST — Initialize shadcn/ui (V29 — before generating any component):**
```bash
# Run inside the web app directory: apps/[app-name]/
npx shadcn@latest init
# Select: New York style, CSS variables, globals.css path
# This creates components.json and configures Tailwind + CSS variables
# Then install base components every app needs:
npx shadcn@latest add button card dialog input label select textarea toast sonner
# Additional components added per PRODUCT.md requirements during this Part
```
IF PRODUCT.md declares dashboards/analytics → also run: `npx shadcn@latest add chart`
IF PRODUCT.md declares data tables → also run: `npx shadcn@latest add table data-table`
IF PRODUCT.md declares forms → also run: `npx shadcn@latest add form field`
IF PRODUCT.md declares sidebar navigation → also run: `npx shadcn@latest add sidebar`

Each web app in inputs.yml apps list gets:
- `tsconfig.json` extending `../../tsconfig.base.json`
- `src/env.ts` — ALL env vars typed and validated at startup (Zod)
- `src/app/` — App Router layout, pages for every module in spec
- `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` — tRPC API handler
- `src/server/trpc/` — tRPC routers for every entity/module
- `src/server/auth/` — Auth.js / Keycloak / chosen auth provider config
- `src/middleware.ts` — tenant resolution from URL path or subdomain, auth guard
- `src/components/` — page-level components per module
- `next.config.ts` — typed Next.js config
- All source files `.ts` / `.tsx` only — zero `.js` in src/

**Always generate — regardless of tenancy mode (Rule 7B):**

- `src/server/trpc/middleware/rbac.ts` — RBAC role guard (L3 — always active):
  ```ts
  export const requireRole = (...allowedRoles: Role[]) =>
    t.middleware(({ ctx, next }) => {
      if (!ctx.roles.some(r => allowedRoles.includes(r))) {
        throw new TRPCError({ code: 'FORBIDDEN' });
      }
      return next({ ctx });
    });
  ```

- `src/server/trpc/context.ts` — base tRPC context:
  ```ts
  export async function createTRPCContext({ req, res }) {
    const session = await getServerSession(req, res, authOptions);
    return {
      session,
      userId:   session?.user?.id ?? null,
      roles:    session?.user?.roles ?? [],
    };
  }
  ```

**Additionally if `tenancy.mode: multi` — (Rule 7 L1):**
  ```ts
  tenantId: session?.user?.tenantId ?? null,
  ```
- `src/server/trpc/middleware/tenant.ts` — tenant guard middleware

**`next.config.ts` — security headers (NEW V18 — always generate):**

GENERATE these HTTP security headers in every web app's `next.config.ts`.
These headers apply to every response. Never omit them. Never comment them out.

```ts
const securityHeaders = [
  // Prevent clickjacking — deny framing from other origins
  { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'SAMEORIGIN' },
  // Prevent MIME type sniffing
  { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
  // Force HTTPS for 1 year, include subdomains
  { key: 'Strict-Transport-Security', value: 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains' },
  // Disable browser features not needed by the app
  { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()' },
  // Control referrer information sent with requests
  { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
  // Basic XSS protection for older browsers
  { key: 'X-XSS-Protection', value: '1; mode=block' },
  // Content Security Policy — restrict resource loading to same origin by default
  // IMPORTANT: tighten this per app — add external domains your app loads from
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: [
      "default-src 'self'",
      "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'",  // tighten after dev
      "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
      "img-src 'self' data: blob:",
      "font-src 'self'",
      "connect-src 'self'",
      "frame-ancestors 'none'",
    ].join('; '),
  },
];

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/(.*)',   // apply to ALL routes
        headers: securityHeaders,
      },
    ];
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

**`src/server/lib/rate-limit.ts` — default rate limiter (NEW V18 — always generate):**

GENERATE this file in every web app. Uses in-memory store for dev/single-instance.
For multi-instance prod: swap the store for Redis (change 1 line — see comment).
ALWAYS wire this into the tRPC context so every route has rate limiting available.

```ts
// src/server/lib/rate-limit.ts
// In-memory rate limiter — works for single-instance deployments (default).
// For multi-instance (multiple app containers): replace LRUCache with Redis store.
// Import: import { rateLimit } from '@/server/lib/rate-limit'

import { LRUCache } from 'lru-cache';
import { TRPCError } from '@trpc/server';

type Options = {
  uniqueTokenPerInterval?: number;  // max unique tokens tracked (default: 500)
  interval?: number;                // window in ms (default: 60_000 = 1 minute)
  limit?: number;                   // max requests per token per window (default: 60)
};

export function rateLimit(options?: Options) {
  const tokenCache = new LRUCache<string, number[]>({
    max: options?.uniqueTokenPerInterval ?? 500,
    ttl: options?.interval ?? 60_000,
  });

  return {
    check: (token: string, limit?: number) => {
      const maxRequests = limit ?? options?.limit ?? 60;
      const tokenCount = tokenCache.get(token) ?? [];
      const now = Date.now();
      const windowStart = now - (options?.interval ?? 60_000);
      const requestsInWindow = tokenCount.filter((t) => t > windowStart);

      if (requestsInWindow.length >= maxRequests) {
        throw new TRPCError({
          code: 'TOO_MANY_REQUESTS',
          message: 'Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.',
        });
      }

      tokenCache.set(token, [...requestsInWindow, now]);
    },
  };
}

// Pre-configured limiters for common use cases.
// Use these in tRPC middleware or route handlers directly.
export const rateLimiters = {
  // Public endpoints (unauthenticated) — strict
  public: rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, limit: 30 }),
  // Auth endpoints (login, register, password reset) — very strict
  auth: rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, limit: 10 }),
  // Authenticated API calls — generous
  api: rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, limit: 120 }),
  // File upload endpoints — conservative
  upload: rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, limit: 20 }),
};
```

WIRE rate limiting into tRPC base procedure in `src/server/trpc/trpc.ts`:
```ts
// In the publicProcedure and protectedProcedure base:
// Use req IP or session userId as the rate limit token
const ip = req.headers['x-forwarded-for']?.toString() ?? req.socket.remoteAddress ?? 'unknown';
rateLimiters.api.check(ctx.session?.user?.id ?? ip);
```

**`src/server/lib/sanitize.ts` — HTML sanitizer for user-submitted content (NEW V18):**

GENERATE this file. Use it anywhere user-submitted content is stored and later rendered as HTML.
ALWAYS import and call `sanitize()` before writing user HTML content to the database.

```ts
// src/server/lib/sanitize.ts
// Strips dangerous HTML from user-submitted content before database storage.
// Prevents XSS — stored cross-site scripting attacks.
// Usage: const clean = sanitize(userInput)

import DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';

export function sanitize(dirty: string): string {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'p', 'br', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'a'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'target', 'rel'],
    FORCE_BODY: true,
  });
}

// For plain text fields — strips ALL HTML
export function sanitizePlainText(dirty: string): string {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, { ALLOWED_TAGS: [], ALLOWED_ATTR: [] });
}
```

ADD `isomorphic-dompurify` and `lru-cache` to the web app `package.json` dependencies.
These are runtime dependencies, not devDependencies.

**`Dockerfile` — production image (NEW V15 — generated if `docker.publish: true` in inputs.yml):**

Multi-stage build. Stage 1 installs deps, Stage 2 builds, Stage 3 is a minimal runtime image.
Next.js output must be set to `standalone` in `next.config.ts` for this to work.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1 — install dependencies
FROM node:22-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g pnpm
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Stage 2 — build
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
RUN pnpm build

# Stage 3 — minimal production runner
FROM node:22-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs && adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT=3000
ENV HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**`next.config.ts` must include `output: 'standalone'` for the Dockerfile to work:**
```ts
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
  // ... rest of config
};
```

**`.dockerignore`** — always generate alongside the Dockerfile:
```
node_modules
.next
.turbo
.git
.env*
!.env.example
*.md
coverage
.code-review-graph
```

⚠️ SKIP Dockerfile generation if `docker.publish: false` in inputs.yml.

### PART 6 — apps/[mobile app] (Expo full scaffold)

⚠️ Skip this part entirely if no mobile app is declared in inputs.yml.

If mobile app declared:
- `app.json` / `app.config.ts` — Expo config
- `eas.json` — EAS Build config for App Store + Play Store
- `src/env.ts` — typed env vars for mobile
- `src/components/ui/` — React Native Reusables + NativeWind setup
- `src/app/` — **Expo Router** screens for every mobile workflow in spec
- `src/api/` — uses `packages/api-client/` ONLY (NEVER packages/db — Rule 13)
- `src/storage/` — **WatermelonDB / AsyncStorage / MMKV** for local persistence
- `src/sync/` — offline queue + sync logic (only if offline-first declared)
- `src/notifications/` — **Expo Push** / FCM+APNs notification setup (only if declared)
- All source files `.ts` / `.tsx` only

### PART 7 — tools/ + deploy/compose/ + K8s scaffold + SocratiCode artifacts
- `tools/` — `validate-inputs.mjs`, `check-env.mjs`, `check-product-sync.mjs`, `hydration-lint.mjs`
  - `check-product-sync.mjs` — validates no private-tag content leaked into governance docs (Rule 20)
- `deploy/compose/dev|stage|prod/` — split compose files per service group (see templates below)
  - `docker-compose.app.yml` (dev) — uses `build:` + `image:` (builds from source, tags locally)
  - `docker-compose.app.yml` (stage) — uses `image:` ONLY — NO build: key — pulls tag from APP_IMAGE_TAG in .env.staging
  - `docker-compose.app.yml` (prod)  — uses `image:` ONLY — NO build: key — pulls tag from APP_IMAGE_TAG in .env.prod
  RULE: staging and prod compose files must NEVER have a build: key — Docker Hub pull only
- `deploy/compose/start.sh` — convenience startup script (dev: --build flag on app service)
- `deploy/compose/push.sh` — NEW V22: manual image promotion pipeline (dev→hub, dev→staging, staging→prod)
  Fill in APP_NAME from inputs.yml apps[0].name when generating this file.
  Fill in IMAGE_NAME from inputs.yml docker.image_name.
  CONDITIONAL: only generate if docker.publish: true in inputs.yml.
- `COMMANDS.md` — NEW V22: master reference of all dev commands (see template below)
- `deploy/k8s-scaffold/` — inactive placeholder with README
- `COMMANDS.md` (NEW V22 — generated at project root, HUMAN-readable reference):
⚠️ CONDITIONAL — only generate if docker.publish: true in inputs.yml.
Fill in APP_NAME, IMAGE_NAME, and APP_PORT from inputs.yml when generating.

**`.socraticodecontextartifacts.json`** — SocratiCode context artifacts config.
  **MERGE, never overwrite.** If Phase 2.6 already wrote a design-system entry, preserve it and add the 4 entries below alongside it:

  ```

**Compose file rules (all environments):**
- Every compose file uses `env_file: ../../.env.${ENV}` — never hardcode credentials inline
- Every stateful service (PostgreSQL, Valkey, MinIO) declares a named volume using the pattern:
  `${APP_SLUG}_${ENV}_${service}_data` — guarantees full data isolation between environments
- `docker-compose.db.yml` always starts first — it creates the shared Docker network
- All other compose files reference the network as `external: true`
- Staging and prod use standard ports (5432, 6379, 9000) — dev uses non-standard ports from inputs.yml
- **Mono-server default:** All services run on the same host for dev/staging/prod.
  To externalize any service: update the HOST env var in `.env.${ENV}` and remove that
  service's compose file from the startup sequence. Zero code changes required.

**Compose file templates (Claude Code generates for all 3 environments — dev/stage/prod):**

`deploy/compose/{env}/docker-compose.db.yml`:
```yaml
# Runs PostgreSQL + PgBouncer on the same host (mono-server default)

**`deploy/compose/{env}/pgadmin-servers.json`** — pre-configured server connection (NEW V16):
Claude Code generates this file alongside `docker-compose.pgadmin.yml` for each environment.
pgAdmin reads it on first startup — no manual server registration needed.

Note: pgAdmin connects to PostgreSQL via the Docker internal network hostname
(`${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_postgres`) — not localhost. This works because both
containers share the same Docker network (`${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_network`).

**After generating this file, add to DECISIONS_LOG.md:**
```
Docker image publishing: enabled
Registry:    docker.io (Docker Hub)
Repository:  ${docker.hub_repo}
Image name:  ${docker.image_name}
Tags:        latest (main branch) + sha-{short} (every push)
Platforms:   linux/amd64, linux/arm64
Trigger:     push to main only (Rule 23 squash-merge guarantees clean main)
Secrets needed in GitHub repo:
  DOCKERHUB_USERNAME — Docker Hub username
  DOCKERHUB_TOKEN    — Docker Hub access token (not password)
```

**Governance docs:** Append to `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` (Agent: CLAUDE_CODE).
Rewrite `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md` — complete current state snapshot.

**`MANIFEST.txt`** — lists EVERY file generated across ALL 8 parts.

**SocratiCode initial index:**
After Part 8, Claude Code triggers SocratiCode to index the newly built codebase:
```
Ask AI: "Index this codebase"
→ codebase_index {}
→ codebase_status {} (poll until complete)
→ codebase_context_index {} (index the context artifacts)
```

After Part 8 complete → STOP. Human manually triggers Phase 5: say "Start Phase 5" in a new Claude Code session. This is consistent with Rule 24 fresh-context discipline — never auto-chain phases.

---

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4 OUTPUT CONTRACT — MANDATORY (applies to every Part 1–8)
Before reporting any Part complete and before squash-merging, verify:
□ All expected files for this Part exist (run find command to confirm)
□ pnpm lint: 0 errors for files changed in this Part
□ pnpm typecheck: 0 errors for files changed in this Part
□ STATE.md rewritten with PHASE="Phase 4 Part N complete"
□ CHANGELOG_AI.md entry written for this Part
□ scaffold/part-N branch squash-merged to main, branch deleted
IF ANY item fails → Part = INCOMPLETE → fix → re-verify → then merge
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## PHASE PROGRESSION — HUMAN-TRIGGERED (V26)

Each phase runs in its own Claude Code session. Human triggers the next phase explicitly.
No auto-chaining. This is consistent with Rule 24 fresh-context discipline.

```
Phase 4 Part 8 complete → STOP
    ↓ human says "Start Phase 5"
Phase 5 — runs all 9 validation commands, self-heals failures → STOP
    ↓ human says "Start Phase 6"
Phase 6 — starts Docker services, runs migrations + seed, runs Visual QA → STOP
    ↓ human says "Feature Update" for Phase 7
Phase 7 — the daily loop. Each Feature Update is its own cycle.
```

**Why human-triggered:** Gives you a natural checkpoint between phases. You can pause,
inspect outputs, fix environment issues, or take a break. Fresh context per phase
produces better results than accumulating context across phase boundaries.

**Triggers:**
```
After Phase 4 Part 8 completes: say "Start Phase 5" in a new Claude Code session
After Phase 5 passes:           say "Start Phase 6" in a new Claude Code session
After Phase 6 completes:        say "Feature Update" for each new feature (Phase 7)
```

---

## PHASE 5 — VALIDATION
**Who:** Claude Code (human-triggered: "Start Phase 5" — Cline deprecated) | **Where:** WSL2 terminal

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file) before starting. Estimate scope + tokens. If >12 files or >80K tokens, split validation into module groups.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5 PRE-FLIGHT — CREDENTIAL COMPLETENESS GATE — MANDATORY (NEW V30)
Before running validation commands, verify CREDENTIALS.md has no unfilled required placeholders:

□ Run: grep -c "⏳" CREDENTIALS.md
   - IF the count returns 0: all placeholders filled → proceed to validation.
   - IF count > 0: identify which sections still have ⏳ markers and check if they are REQUIRED.

□ REQUIRED sections (block Phase 5 if ⏳ present):
   - 🐙 GitHub: Username + Personal Access Token
   - 🐳 Docker Hub: Username + Access Token (only if docker.publish: true in inputs.yml)
   - 📧 SMTP: Host + Port + Username + Password + From address + From name (staging/prod only — dev uses MailHog)
   - 🦎 Komodo: UI URL (only if deployment.manager: komodo in inputs.yml)
   - 💳 Xendit: All API keys + webhook token (only if payment.gateway: xendit in inputs.yml)
   - 🛡️ Cloudflare Turnstile: LIVE Site Key + LIVE Secret Key (prod only — dev/staging use pre-filled test keys)

□ OPTIONAL sections (allow ⏳ to remain — validation passes):
   - Komodo webhook URLs + webhook secret (only needed for legacy webhook-triggered deploys)
   - Third-Party API Keys (project-specific — fill as you integrate each service)

□ IF any REQUIRED field still has ⏳:
   → Output:
     "🔴 Phase 5 blocked — CREDENTIALS.md has unfilled required fields:
        [list each unfilled section with ⏳ marker]

      Open CREDENTIALS.md and replace the ⏳ placeholders with real values from:
        - GitHub: github.com/settings/tokens (PAT with repo + workflow scope)
        - Docker Hub: hub.docker.com → Account Settings → Security → New Access Token
        - SMTP: your email provider (Gmail app password, SendGrid API key, etc.)
        - Komodo: your Komodo Core UI URL
        - Xendit: dashboard.xendit.co → Settings → API Keys (test + live)
        - Turnstile: dash.cloudflare.com → Turnstile → your widget → copy keys

      After filling: run 'bash scripts/sync-credentials-to-env.sh' to propagate values
      into .env.dev / .env.staging / .env.prod. Then retry 'Start Phase 5'."
   → STOP. Do not run validation commands.

□ IF all REQUIRED fields are filled (only OPTIONAL ⏳ remain): proceed to validation.

Note: Phase 5 does not read credential VALUES — only checks for unfilled ⏳ markers.
This gate catches the case where a human forgot to fill credentials after Bootstrap completed
with placeholders. Running validation with placeholder values would cause cryptic failures
(e.g. "authentication failed" on the DB) instead of a clear "fill CREDENTIALS.md" message.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Claude Code runs all 9 commands. Fixes every failure before proceeding.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm tools:validate-inputs
pnpm tools:check-env
pnpm tools:check-product-sync
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
```

The 9th command — `pnpm audit` — scans all dependencies for known CVEs.
FAIL if any HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerability is found. Fix before proceeding to Phase 6.

**CVE resolution decision tree (NEW V21) — follow in order, do not skip steps:**
```
Step 1: Run pnpm audit --fix
  IF all HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs resolved → re-run audit → confirm clean → proceed.

Step 2 (if Step 1 fails): Upgrade the affected package to its latest major version.
  IF all CVEs resolved → run pnpm test → if tests pass → proceed.

Step 3 (if Steps 1+2 fail — no available fix exists):
  → Write to DECISIONS_LOG.md:
      UNFIXED CVE: [CVE ID] in [package]@[version]
      No fix available as of [date]. Risk accepted: YES.
      Mitigation: [e.g. "package not exposed to user input"]
  → Add to .npmrc: audit-level=critical
  → Append 🔴 gotcha to lessons.md: "Unfixed HIGH CVE: [package] — revisit on next pnpm update"
  → Output: "⚠ Unfixed HIGH CVE accepted with documented mitigation — see DECISIONS_LOG.md"
  → Proceed to Phase 6.

CRITICAL CVE (any step): NEVER accept unfixed.
  → Output HANDOFF_OUTPUT immediately. Escalate to human. Do not proceed.
```

Never suppress TypeScript errors with `any` — fix at source.
All 9 commands must pass (or HIGH CVE explicitly mitigated per above) before Phase 6.

If running manually: run in WSL2 terminal.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5 OUTPUT CONTRACT — MANDATORY
Before proceeding to Phase 6, verify ALL of these:
□ pnpm install --frozen-lockfile: exit 0
□ pnpm tools:validate-inputs: exit 0
□ pnpm tools:check-env: exit 0
□ pnpm tools:check-product-sync: exit 0
□ pnpm lint: 0 errors (warnings allowed)
□ pnpm typecheck: 0 errors
□ pnpm test: all tests pass
□ pnpm build: exit 0
□ pnpm audit --audit-level=high: 0 HIGH or CRITICAL CVEs
□ lint-deploy.sh: exit 0 — run `bash scripts/lint-deploy.sh deploy/compose` before any staging/prod push; catches
  the shared Traefik/Komodo footguns (compose parse, certresolver case, tls=true label, 127.0.0.1 healthcheck,
  no build: in stage/prod, push.sh login guard, start.sh project-name, shellcheck). Fix all FAILs before Phase 6.
□ design:check: exit 0 — run `npm run design:check` (Playwright toHaveScreenshot vs production baseline in
  tests/visual/fixtures/). A non-zero exit = visual drift detected = GATE FAIL. Two legal reconcile paths only:
  (1) fix the code so screenshots match the baseline; OR (2) update-design-first → recompile
  (design:validate → design:build) → re-capture baseline as a reviewed human commit → re-run design:check.
  No other path permitted. (V32.8 — Rule 31)
□ REGISTRY DONE-CLAIM (V32.8 — Rule 32): scan LESSONS_REGISTRY.md for fingerprints matching Phase 5's
  surface; capture design:check output into STATE.md evidence field {contract, check_command, captured_output}.
IF ANY command fails → fix before proceeding → do not start Phase 6 with failing validation

PHASE 5 FAILURE HANDLING (V32.8 — Rule 32): On any build/test/gate failure:
  1. Fingerprint the failure: {scope_category, surface, symptom, check_command_that_caught_it}
  2. Scan LESSONS_REGISTRY.md for a matching fingerprint.
  3. IF it matches an existing entry whose standing_check should have caught it:
     STRENGTHEN that check (update its check_location / add it to an earlier phase hook) — do not just re-fix.
  4. IF it is novel: flag as a promotion candidate in STATE.md ("promote-to-registry: YES, scope: project|framework").
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**When all 9 pass, lint-deploy.sh is green, and design:check is green → Phase 5 is complete. Output "✅ Phase 5 complete. Say 'Start Phase 6' in a new Claude Code session."**
Human triggers Phase 6 explicitly.

---

## PHASE 6 — START DOCKER SERVICES
**Who:** Claude Code (human-triggered: "Start Phase 6" — Cline deprecated) or you manually | **Where:** WSL2 terminal

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file) before starting. Phase 6 typically reads compose files + .env + governance docs — estimate tokens before proceeding.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

**⚠️ PRE-DEPLOY FOOTGUN GATE — run before any staging/prod push:**
```bash
bash scripts/lint-deploy.sh deploy/compose
```
This static linter encodes the shared Traefik/Komodo gotchas that have broken fleet deploys:
C1 compose YAML parse · C2 certresolver lowercase · C3 websecure tls=true label · C4 127.0.0.1
healthcheck (not localhost) · C5 no build: key in stage/prod composes · C6 push.sh login guard ·
C7 start.sh COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME derivation · C8 shellcheck all *.sh.
Exit 0 = all clear. Exit 1 = fix before proceeding. Dev compose is excluded from TLS/build: checks.

All `docker compose` commands run from the WSL2 Ubuntu terminal.
Docker Desktop provides the socket natively — no DinD, no socket mounts needed.

**⚠️ Always start `docker-compose.db.yml` first.**

**Dev/Test ports are NON-STANDARD** (set in inputs.yml during Phase 3, locked in .env.dev):
Services use unique random ports derived from a per-project base (Rule 22 Part A).
Example: base=42731 → PostgreSQL:42731, Valkey:42733, App:42741, MinIO:42734.
Never conflicts with other projects or standard services running on the same machine.
Never hardcode port numbers — always read from `process.env` which derives from .env.

One-command startup (recommended):
```bash
bash deploy/compose/start.sh dev up -d
```

Or individually:
```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.db.yml up -d      # FIRST
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.cache.yml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.storage.yml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.app.yml up -d
```

After services are up:
```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

App, MinIO, MailHog ports shown in .env.dev after Phase 3 generation.
Run `cat .env.dev | grep _PORT` to see assigned ports.

**After services are healthy — Phase 6 Visual QA (Rule 16):**
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 6 OUTPUT CONTRACT — MANDATORY
Before reporting complete, verify ALL of these:
□ All Docker services healthy (docker compose ps — no exited or unhealthy containers)
□ pnpm db:migrate succeeded — zero migration errors
□ pnpm db:seed succeeded — seed data populated
□ App responds at configured dev port (health endpoint returns HTTP 200)
□ Visual QA (Rule 16) passed — all pages load, no console errors, no layout breaks
□ STATE.md rewritten: PHASE="Phase 6 complete", NEXT="Feature Update (Phase 7)"
IF ANY item fails → Phase 6 = INCOMPLETE → fix → re-verify before proceeding
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

All checks pass → Phase 6 complete. Chain ends here.
Any check fails → Claude Code attempts one auto-fix, retries, writes handoff if still failing.

After Phase 6 completes, output EXACTLY:
```
✅ Phase 6 complete. Your app is live.

  App:     http://localhost:${APP_PORT}   (check .env.dev for actual port)
  MinIO:   http://localhost:${MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT}
  MailHog: http://localhost:${MAILHOG_PORT}

  Run: cat .env.dev | grep _PORT   to see all assigned ports.

⚡ CODE-REVIEW-GRAPH SETUP (run now — required before Phase 7):
  → In your WSL2 terminal (not Claude Code), run:
    cd /path/to/your/project
    code-review-graph build
  → This indexes the entire codebase into a SQLite knowledge graph.
  → Takes 1-3 minutes depending on codebase size.
  → After this, Claude Code can use blast radius analysis before every
    Feature Update — knowing exactly which files a change will affect.
  → See: https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph

  Verify it worked:
    code-review-graph status
  → Should show: indexed files count, last build timestamp.

  If code-review-graph is not installed:
    See Scenario 21 in the framework for installation instructions.

Next steps:
→ To add features:    edit docs/PRODUCT.md → say "Feature Update" in Claude Code
→ To see what's left: say "Start Phase 8" in Claude Code
→ To run a retro:     say "Governance Retro" in Claude Code
→ All commands:       see README.md in your project root
```

## PHASE 6.5 — FIRST RUN ERROR TRIAGE
**Trigger:** Say "First Run Error" + paste full error output

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file). Error triage can snowball — if fixing requires touching >12 files, split into separate fix sessions per error category.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

Diagnose from these categories:
- **ENV_MISSING** → check .env against .env.example
- **MIGRATION_FAILED** → run pnpm db:migrate
- **PORT_CONFLICT** → lsof -i :<port>, kill process, retry. Note: dev/test uses non-standard ports (e.g. 54320 for PG, 53000 for app) — if conflict still occurs, regenerate port assignments: edit inputs.yml port values → run Phase 7 → restart services
- **IMAGE_BUILD_FAILED** → fix exact failing Dockerfile line
- **DEPENDENCY_NOT_INSTALLED** → pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- **TYPECHECK_FAILED** → fix at source per file + line, never suppress
- **SERVICE_UNHEALTHY** → check that compose group's logs
- **AUTH_MISCONFIGURED** → check AUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL in .env
- **DB_CONNECTION_REFUSED** → verify DATABASE_URL matches compose service name
- **CORS_ERROR** → check allowed origins in middleware or tRPC config
- **VISUAL_QA_FAILED** → check browser console errors, verify seed data exists, check auth config
- **SOCRATICODE_NOT_INDEXED** → ensure Docker is running, run codebase_index, poll codebase_status
- **PRIVATE_TAG_LEAKED** → private-tagged content found in governance doc; run pnpm tools:check-product-sync to identify and remove
- **DESIGN_SYSTEM_MISSING** → design-system/MASTER.md referenced but not found; run Phase 2.6 manually or install UI UX Pro Max skill (`/plugin install ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill`) then re-run
- **PORT_ALREADY_BOUND** → generated dev port already in use; check lsof -i :<port>, update the port in inputs.yml + .env.dev, restart that compose service
- **PGADMIN_UNREACHABLE** → pgAdmin container started but UI not loading; common causes: (1) pgadmin_data volume permissions — fix: docker compose down → docker volume rm ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}_pgadmin_data → docker compose up -d; (2) pgadmin-servers.json missing or malformed — fix: verify file exists at deploy/compose/{env}/pgadmin-servers.json; (3) postgres container not yet healthy when pgAdmin started — fix: ensure postgres healthcheck passes before pgAdmin depends_on resolves; access URL: http://localhost:${PGADMIN_PORT}

Output format — EXACTLY this structure, no variations:
```
CATEGORY: [one of the category names above, e.g. ENV_MISSING]
ROOT CAUSE: [one sentence — what specifically is wrong]
FIX:
  [exact command 1]
  [exact command 2]
VERIFY: [exact command to confirm the fix worked]
```

## PHASE 7 — FEATURE UPDATE LOOP
**Who:** Claude Code (primary — Cline deprecated, do not use) | **Where:** VS Code

**This is the most important phase. Use it for EVERY change after Phase 4.**
Edit PRODUCT.md → trigger Phase 7 → agents implement everything and keep governance in sync.

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET — MANDATORY FOR EVERY FEATURE UPDATE:**
> You are Claude Sonnet 4.6. Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file)
> BEFORE starting any Feature Update. Estimate total files to read + create + modify.
> If >12 files OR >80K estimated tokens → split the Feature Update into sub-features:
>   - Group related changes by module (e.g. "schema + router" then "UI pages" in separate sessions)
>   - Each sub-feature gets its own branch: `feat/[feature]-[module]`
>   - Commit + STOP after each sub-feature → human opens new session for next module
> Read ONLY the PRODUCT.md sections for the current feature — NEVER the full file.
> Use `codebase_search` (Rule 17) before opening source files.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE** (memory-governance.md): PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1) — classify this Feature Update's complexity before touching any files. POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) on completion. MODEL: ZERO OPUS EXECUTION (V32.3). Opus's only allowed actions: (a) READ context — non-allow-list files > 100 lines MUST go through Scout-Sonnet (R6); **V32.3:** allow-list governance docs > 200 lines also MUST go through Scout-Sonnet with the Governance Extraction Schema (`memory-governance.md §4`) — direct Opus read of a > 200-line allow-list governance doc counts as `opus_writes` for `dispatch_ratio` purposes; (b) plan, decompose, review Sonnet output — DONE acceptance requires full diff review, review-by-summary FORBIDDEN; (c) WRITE only the R8 Allow-List (docs/STATE.md · docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md · docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md · docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md · .cline/STATE.md). ALL other file writes (code, configs, tests) MUST be dispatched via Agent(subagent_type: "spec-executor") per §4 (fallback: Agent(model: "sonnet") when a task requires tools/MCPs outside spec-executor's allow-list). ≥ 2 independent dispatches MUST be parallel in ONE Opus response — serial only with a real data dependency (R7). Before each dispatch: run `wc -l`; total ≤ 500 lines per Sonnet task; files > 300 lines need explicit line ranges. **V32.3 Smart Governance Hydration:** at Phase 7 start, hydrate the 9 governance docs per Rule 4 — files ≤ 200 lines direct read; files > 200 lines via Scout with Governance Extraction Schema. Opus consumes the hydration brief, not the full file. Smart Checkpoint logs `dispatch_ratio` (sonnet_writes / opus_writes ≥ 3.0; < 1.0 triggers lessons.md drift review — R9). NO exceptions. NO "last resort." NO Opus executor escalation. If about to Edit/Write a non-allow-list file, STOP and dispatch.
>
> **MODEL HOOK (V32.5.5 — Back-Port Surface Check, Phase 7 pre-flight):** before executing the Feature Update body, Opus runs the Back-Port Surface Check — dispatch a Sonnet Scout to compare every locked decision in `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` against `docs/PRODUCT.md`. The Scout returns a structured report listing decisions ABSENT from PRODUCT.md (entity · decision value · log timestamp · suggested PRODUCT.md section). Opus surfaces the report at the top of phase output as **"📋 Back-Port Candidates"** — **non-blocking, informational only; it NEVER gates phase closure.** Rule 1 is unchanged: PRODUCT.md edits remain human-only — Claude Code MUST NOT write to `docs/PRODUCT.md`. If the human declines to back-port a candidate, they log `spec-divergent: <reason>` in DECISIONS_LOG.md to suppress it on the next run. The check is conditional: run the Scout ONLY when `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` mtime is newer than the last Back-Port Candidates report (`docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` timestamp). On a clean state (no candidates) emit a single collapsed line — `✅ no back-port candidates` — not the full report.
>
> **MODEL HOOK (V32.7.3 — Design Baseline Back-Port Surface Check, Phase 7 pre-flight):** the same posture as the V32.5.5 spec check, applied to the design baseline. The Phase 3.3 hard gate (V32.6) finalizes `docs/DESIGN.md` tokens + `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` as the UI source of truth, but an owner-approved design change (palette / theme / layout) can land AFTER that gate closes — during a Phase 7 UI-delta Feature Update (also Phase 4 Parts 5-6 or Phase 8). When that happens, the live app theme drifts from the frozen baseline (the Marine-Guardian failure mode: Meta-Dark mockup frozen, shadcn-neutral re-skin shipped, baseline never updated). Before executing a UI-touching Feature Update body, Opus runs the Design Baseline Back-Port Surface Check — dispatch a Sonnet Scout to **diff the app's live theme tokens (`apps/[web]/src/app/globals.css` CSS variables + the Tailwind theme config) against the baseline tokens in `docs/DESIGN.md` / `docs/MOCKUP.jsx`** (this is the detection mechanism that closes framework TODO-21 — the per-wave `globals.css` ↔ `MOCKUP.jsx` token diff). The Scout returns a structured report listing tokens that DIVERGED (token name · baseline value · live value · file:line). Opus surfaces it at the top of phase output as **"🎨 Design Back-Port Candidates"** — **non-blocking, informational only; it NEVER gates phase closure.** The requirement on an owner-approved divergence is **INHERIT-not-REPLACE back-port**: update `docs/DESIGN.md` to the new token values AND annotate/expand `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` to reflect them (annotate/expand the existing mockup — full regenerate ONLY on a wholesale design change; the mockup stays the UI source of truth, never silently overwritten). Unlike spec files, `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` are NOT human-only — Claude Code MAY write the back-port, but only to mirror an already-approved change, never to invent design intent (Rule 1 preserved: the design *decision* is the human's; Claude only reconciles the baseline to it). If the human intends the divergence to stay un-mirrored, they log `design-divergent: <reason>` in DECISIONS_LOG.md to suppress it on the next run. The check is conditional: run the Scout ONLY when `globals.css` or the Tailwind theme config mtime is newer than the last Design Back-Port report (`docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` timestamp), AND the Feature Update touches UI files. On a clean state (tokens match) emit a single collapsed line — `✅ no design back-port candidates` — not the full report.
>
> **MODEL HOOK (V32.8 — New-Surface Mockup-First + Registry Consult, Phase 7):** **(a) New-surface rule (Rule 31):** If this Feature Update introduces a NEW UI surface (new page, new modal, new significant component not present in `prototype/` or `docs/MOCKUP.jsx`), a DESIGN/mockup update MUST happen FIRST — before any implementation code is written. Update `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` (annotate/expand — never regenerate from scratch, Rule 1) to include the new surface, run `design:validate` → `design:build` to recompile tokens, re-capture the affected baseline snapshot, then transcribe to production code. Ad-hoc UI invention (building a screen that has no corresponding mockup entry) is NOT permitted. **(b) Registry consult (Rule 32):** Before executing the Feature Update body, consult `LESSONS_REGISTRY.md` for fingerprints matching this update's target surface. **(c) Registry done-claim:** On Feature Update completion, scan `LESSONS_REGISTRY.md` for surface-relevant fingerprints; capture acceptance-check output into STATE.md `{contract, check_command, captured_output}` before claiming done. **(d) Failure handling:** On any build/test/gate failure during this Feature Update: fingerprint it → scan registry → if a standing check should have caught it, STRENGTHEN that check; if novel, flag as a promotion candidate in STATE.md.

**Trigger:**
- Via Claude Code: say "Feature Update" — it hydrates the 9 governance docs automatically (V32.3: large docs via Scout, small docs direct)
- Via Copilot (emergency fallback only): say "Feature Update" + attach all 9 docs manually (no Scout available)

**PRE-FLIGHT CHECK — MANDATORY before Phase 7 sequence (NEW V21):**
```
0. code-review-graph check:
   IF .code-review-graph/ directory exists:
   → Good — blast radius analysis is available for this Feature Update.
   IF .code-review-graph/ directory does NOT exist:
   → Output WARNING: "code-review-graph is not set up. Blast radius analysis
     will not be available. Run 'code-review-graph build' in WSL2 terminal
     to enable it. Continuing without it — using codebase_search as fallback."
   → Continue (not blocking — but blast radius won't be available).

1. inputs.yml existence check:
   IF inputs.yml does not exist:
   → Output GAP_REPORT: SECTION: inputs.yml  PROBLEM: File missing — Phase 7 cannot run
     FIX: Re-run Phase 3 to regenerate, or restore from git: git checkout main -- inputs.yml
   → STOP. Wait for human to restore the file before proceeding.

2. inputs.yml schema validation:
   Run: pnpm tools:validate-inputs
   IF validation fails:
   → Output GAP_REPORT: SECTION: inputs.yml  PROBLEM: Schema validation failed — [list errors]
     FIX: Fix each listed field in inputs.yml then re-run pnpm tools:validate-inputs
   → STOP. Wait for human to fix inputs.yml before proceeding.

3. Git branch existence check:
   IF branch feat/[feature-slug] already exists:
   → DO NOT create a new branch. DO NOT error.
   → Run: git checkout feat/[feature-slug]
   → Append to agent-log.md: "RESUMED existing branch feat/[slug] — branch already existed"
   → Inspect git log for any partial work already committed on this branch.
   → Continue from Phase 7 step 4 (SocratiCode search).
```

**Agent behavior — MANDATORY SEQUENCE. Execute in this exact order. Do not skip or reorder:**

1. Read all 9 context docs — lessons.md first (ALL 🔴 gotchas → ALL 🟤 decisions → rest). Do not proceed until all 9 are read.
2. CONDITIONAL (Rule 21) — Design system check:
   IF the feature changes any file in apps/[web]/src/components/, apps/[web]/src/app/, or packages/ui/:
     → run: codebase_context_search { name: "design-system" }
     → if design-system/pages/[page].md exists for the specific page being changed → use that file instead of MASTER.md
   IF design-system/MASTER.md does not exist → skip this step entirely. No warning. No error.
   IF the change is backend-only (packages/db, packages/jobs, tRPC routers only) → skip this step entirely.
3. CONDITIONAL (Rule 22) — Blast-radius check:
   IF code-review-graph is installed:
     → run: get_impact_radius_tool with the list of files that PRODUCT.md declares changed
     → run: get_review_context_tool with the impacted files list
     → use the returned file list as the scope for step 8 (implement)
   IF code-review-graph is not installed → skip this step entirely. Use codebase_search results as scope instead.
4. SocratiCode search (Rule 17): run codebase_search for the affected feature area. Do this before opening any file.
5. State current status in 3–5 bullets. Show what exists now and what will change.
6. Rule 9 check: verify PRODUCT.md change → inputs.yml alignment is valid in both directions. REFUSE if violated.
7. Rule 11 check: list every file that will be deleted. Do not delete anything until human confirms with "yes".
8. Rule 20 check: strip all <private>...</private> blocks from PRODUCT.md before processing its content.
9. Clarifying questions: ask ONLY if the answer would change the implementation AND is not already in DECISIONS_LOG.md. Maximum 3 questions. If answer is in DECISIONS_LOG.md — do not ask, use the logged decision.
10. Create git branch before writing any file (Rule 23):
   - Run: git checkout -b feat/[feature-slug-from-PRODUCT.md-change]
   - If branch already exists (resuming): git checkout feat/[slug]
   - NEVER write any file on main. Always on a feature branch.

11. Implement — LINEAR SUB-STEPS. Complete each before starting the next. No batching.

   Step 11a — TEST (MANDATORY — do this BEFORE writing any implementation code):
   - Write a failing test for the declared behaviour. Do not implement yet.
   - Run the test. Confirm it fails (RED). If it passes already: the feature exists — check scope.
   - Do not proceed to 11b until RED is confirmed.

   Step 11b — IMPLEMENT (scope = blast-radius only):
   - Modify ONLY the files returned by get_impact_radius_tool (step 3) or codebase_search (step 4).
   - If a file is not in the blast-radius result and not directly required → do not touch it.
   - Write the minimal code to make the test from 11a pass.
   - Run the test. Confirm it passes (GREEN). If still RED: fix before proceeding.
   - Refactor only after GREEN. Never scaffold devcontainer files (Rule 8).

   Step 11c — METADATA (CONDITIONAL: only if PRODUCT.md declares changed entities or config):
   - Update inputs.yml to match the PRODUCT.md change.
   - Update inputs.schema.json to match.
   - Update TypeScript types in packages/shared/ for any changed entity.
   - IF no entity or config changed: skip this sub-step. Note it in the commit message.

   Step 11d — PERSISTENCE (CONDITIONAL: only if any Prisma model was added, changed, or removed):
   - Write Prisma migration: up + down.
   - Run: pnpm db:generate
   - Verify migration runs clean: pnpm db:migrate
   - IF no model changed: skip this sub-step.

   Step 11e — COMMIT (MANDATORY):
   - One atomic git commit per logical unit of work.
   - Commit message format: feat(module): description  (conventional commits — no vague messages)
   - Delete files only if PRODUCT.md explicitly removes the feature (Rule 11 — confirmation first).
   - Do not bundle unrelated changes into one commit.
12. Update all governance docs — **non-blocking: append after implementation, not during**
   (CHANGELOG_AI with attribution per Rule 15, IMPLEMENTATION_MAP, DECISIONS_LOG if new decision,
   agent-log, lessons.md in Rule 18 typed format if error resolved or decision locked)

   GOVERNANCE SELF-CHECK (MANDATORY — run before proceeding to step 13):
   □ CHANGELOG_AI.md: last entry timestamp matches this session
   □ IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md: updated to reflect the files changed in this Feature Update
   □ STATE.md: rewritten with current PHASE/LAST_DONE/NEXT
   IF any item missing or stale → fix it NOW. Do not proceed to step 13 with stale governance.

13. **Two-stage code review (Rule 25):**
    STAGE 1: Spec compliance — every behaviour declared in PRODUCT.md is implemented.
    STAGE 2: Code quality — no any types, tests written before code, only blast-radius files touched.
    Both stages must PASS before proceeding. Fix and re-check if either fails.
14. **Run Visual QA (Rule 16)** — check all pages touched by this update
15. **Run `codebase_update`** — refresh SocratiCode index with the new changes (Rule 17)
16. **Squash-merge + cleanup (Rule 23):** squash-merge feat/[slug] to main. Delete branch. Rewrite STATE.md.
17. Update all governance docs — **non-blocking: append after merge, not during**
    (CHANGELOG_AI with attribution per Rule 15, IMPLEMENTATION_MAP, DECISIONS_LOG if new decision,
    agent-log, lessons.md in Rule 18 typed format if error resolved or decision locked)
18. Deliver: Claude Code writes directly. Others: delta ZIP with DELTA_MANIFEST.txt.
19. Remind to verify: pnpm tools:check-product-sync && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 7 OUTPUT CONTRACT — MANDATORY
Before reporting Feature Update complete, verify ALL of these:
□ All 5 sub-steps (11a–11e) completed and confirmed
□ Two-stage code review: Stage 1 (spec compliance) PASS + Stage 2 (code quality) PASS
□ CHANGELOG_AI.md: entry written with this session's timestamp and Agent: CLAUDE_CODE
□ IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md: updated to reflect new feature state
□ STATE.md: rewritten with PHASE="Phase 7 complete", LAST_DONE=[feature name], NEXT="Feature Update or Phase 8"
□ feat/[slug] branch squash-merged to main and deleted
□ SocratiCode index refreshed via codebase_update
□ IF this update added a new UI surface: docs/MOCKUP.jsx updated + design:validate/build rerun + baseline re-captured (V32.8 — Rule 31)
□ REGISTRY DONE-CLAIM (V32.8 — Rule 32): LESSONS_REGISTRY.md scanned for surface fingerprints; acceptance check output captured in STATE.md {contract, check_command, captured_output}. Empty evidence field = malformed claim.
IF ANY item fails → Feature Update = INCOMPLETE → fix before marking done
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

---

## PHASE 7R — FEATURE ROLLBACK
**Trigger:**
- Via Claude Code: say "Feature Rollback: [feature name]" — reads all 9 governance docs automatically
- Via Copilot (emergency fallback only): say "Feature Rollback: [feature name]" + attach all 9 docs manually

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file). Rollbacks can touch many files across modules. If the feature spans >12 files, split the rollback into module-by-module sessions: revert schema first, then routers, then UI — commit after each group.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE:** Read `.ai_prompt/memory-governance.md` first, then — PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1). POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) if files changed.

1. Find feature entry in CHANGELOG_AI.md
2. List all files + migrations to revert
3. Show rollback plan — wait for confirmation
4. On confirmation: remove files, write down-migrations, update governance docs
5. Write rollback entry to lessons.md as 🟢 change
6. Run `codebase_update` — refresh SocratiCode index to reflect the rollback
7. Deliver: Claude Code writes directly to workspace. Others: delta ZIP with DELTA_MANIFEST.txt.

---

## PHASE 8 — ITERATIVE BUILDOUT
**Who:** Claude Code (primary — Cline deprecated) | **Trigger:** "Start Phase 8" (Claude Code reads 9 docs auto)

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Run the Universal Context Budget pre-flight (top of this file) before every batch. Estimate files + tokens for the proposed batch. If >12 files or >80K tokens, split into per-feature sub-batches per the anti-thrashing rule below.
>
> **⚠ MEMORY GOVERNANCE** (memory-governance.md): PRE: Run Tiered Decomposition (§1) — classify this batch before starting. POST: Run Smart Checkpoint (§2) after each sub-batch. MODEL: ZERO OPUS EXECUTION (V32.3). Opus's only allowed actions: (a) READ context — but any non-allow-list file > 100 lines MUST go through Scout-Sonnet (R6); **V32.3:** allow-list governance docs > 200 lines also MUST go through Scout-Sonnet with the Governance Extraction Schema (`memory-governance.md §4`) — direct Opus read of a > 200-line allow-list governance doc counts as `opus_writes` for `dispatch_ratio` purposes; (b) plan, decompose, review Sonnet output — DONE acceptance requires full diff review, review-by-summary FORBIDDEN; (c) WRITE only the R8 Allow-List (docs/STATE.md · docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md · docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md · docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md · .cline/STATE.md). ALL other file writes (code, configs, tests) MUST be dispatched via Agent(subagent_type: "spec-executor") per §4 (fallback: Agent(model: "sonnet") when a task requires tools/MCPs outside spec-executor's allow-list). ≥ 2 independent dispatches MUST be parallel in ONE Opus response — serial only with a real data dependency (R7). Before each dispatch: run `wc -l`; total ≤ 500 lines per Sonnet task; files > 300 lines need explicit line ranges. Smart Checkpoint logs `dispatch_ratio` (sonnet_writes / opus_writes ≥ 3.0; < 1.0 triggers lessons.md drift review — R9). NO exceptions. NO "last resort." NO Opus executor escalation. If about to Edit/Write a non-allow-list file, STOP and dispatch.
>
> **MODEL HOOK (V32.5.5 — Back-Port Surface Check, Phase 8 pre-flight):** before proposing the next build batch, Opus runs the Back-Port Surface Check — dispatch a Sonnet Scout to compare every locked decision in `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` against `docs/PRODUCT.md`. The Scout returns a structured report listing decisions ABSENT from PRODUCT.md (entity · decision value · log timestamp · suggested PRODUCT.md section). Opus surfaces the report at the top of the batch proposal as **"📋 Back-Port Candidates"** — **non-blocking, informational only; it NEVER gates the batch or phase closure.** Rule 1 is unchanged: PRODUCT.md edits remain human-only — Claude Code MUST NOT write to `docs/PRODUCT.md`. If the human declines to back-port a candidate, they log `spec-divergent: <reason>` in DECISIONS_LOG.md to suppress it on the next run. The check is conditional: run the Scout ONLY when `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` mtime is newer than the last Back-Port Candidates report (`docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` timestamp). On a clean state (no candidates) emit a single collapsed line — `✅ no back-port candidates` — not the full report. This complements the existing PRODUCT.md ↔ IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md structural completeness check below: completeness catches *unbuilt* declared sections, the Back-Port Check catches *answered clarifications never written back into the spec*.
>
> **MODEL HOOK (V32.7.3 — Design Baseline Back-Port Surface Check, Phase 8 pre-flight):** the design analogue of the V32.5.5 check above, same posture. Before proposing the next build batch, Opus runs the Design Baseline Back-Port Surface Check — dispatch a Sonnet Scout to **diff the app's live theme tokens (`apps/[web]/src/app/globals.css` CSS variables + the Tailwind theme config) against the baseline tokens in `docs/DESIGN.md` / `docs/MOCKUP.jsx`** (closes framework TODO-21 — the per-wave `globals.css` ↔ `MOCKUP.jsx` token diff). The Scout returns a structured report listing diverged tokens (token name · baseline value · live value · file:line). Opus surfaces it at the top of the batch proposal as **"🎨 Design Back-Port Candidates"** — **non-blocking, informational only; it NEVER gates the batch or phase closure.** On an owner-approved divergence the requirement is **INHERIT-not-REPLACE back-port**: update `docs/DESIGN.md` token values AND annotate/expand `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` to match (annotate/expand the existing mockup — full regenerate ONLY on a wholesale design change; the mockup stays the UI source of truth). `docs/DESIGN.md` / `docs/MOCKUP.jsx` are NOT human-only — Claude Code MAY write the back-port, but only to mirror an already-approved change, never to invent design intent (Rule 1 preserved). To leave a divergence un-mirrored, the human logs `design-divergent: <reason>` in DECISIONS_LOG.md to suppress it. Conditional: run the Scout ONLY when `globals.css` / the Tailwind theme config mtime is newer than the last Design Back-Port report (`docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` timestamp). On a clean state emit `✅ no design back-port candidates`. Why both checks at Phase 8: the spec Back-Port Check catches answered clarifications never written back into PRODUCT.md; the Design Back-Port Check catches an approved re-skin never written back into the DESIGN.md / MOCKUP.jsx baseline.
>
> **MODEL HOOK (V32.8 — Registry Consult + design:check gate, Phase 8):** **(a) Work-start registry consult (Rule 32):** Before building each sub-batch, consult `LESSONS_REGISTRY.md` for fingerprints matching the batch's target surface; run any matching `standing_check` before writing code. **(b) design:check gate (Rule 31):** After each sub-batch that touches UI, run `npm run design:check` (Playwright `toHaveScreenshot` vs production baseline). A non-zero exit blocks the sub-batch done-claim. Two legal reconcile paths only: fix code OR update-design-first → `design:validate` → `design:build` → re-capture baseline as reviewed human commit. **(c) Done-claim evidence (Rule 32):** Every sub-batch done-claim must carry `{contract, check_command, captured_output}` in STATE.md. An empty evidence field is structurally malformed.

Cross-references PRODUCT.md vs IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md and proposes the next batch.
Repeats until PRODUCT.md is fully implemented.

**Agent outputs EXACTLY this format:**
```
📋 PHASE 8 — NEXT BUILD BATCH PROPOSAL
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Built so far (from IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md):
  ✅ [list what is confirmed built]

Not yet built (declared in PRODUCT.md but missing from map):
  ⬜ [item 1] — [one-line description]
  ⬜ [item 2] — [one-line description]

Proposed next batch (highest value / most unblocking):
  1. [feature/module] — [why this is highest priority]
  2. [feature/module] — [why this comes second]
  3. [feature/module] — [why this comes third]

Confirm this batch, reorder, or tell me what to change.
Reply "confirmed" to begin.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Wait for confirmation — do NOT start building until confirmed.
On confirmation: run Phase 7 Feature Update for each item in the batch.
After each batch: update all governance docs. Show updated "Not yet built" list.

### ⚠ ANTI-THRASHING RULE — MANDATORY (applies to ALL Phase 8 Batches)

**Model context:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Claude Code. 200K token context window,
~120K practical working budget, ≤80K SAFE zone for input context. Every file read,
governance doc loaded, and PRODUCT.md section parsed consumes from this budget.
The 12-file threshold is calibrated for this model: each file + overhead averages
~6-8K tokens, so 12 files ≈ 80-96K ≈ the edge of the SAFE zone.

**Problem:** On large apps with many modules, Phase 8 batches trigger "Autocompact is thrashing"
because Claude Code tries to read the full PRODUCT.md + full codebase + all governance docs
at once, filling the 120K context window within 2-3 turns. Features get silently dropped,
code gets generated incomplete, or the session produces broken output.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Anti-thrashing exists to PROTECT the build, not to shortcut it.
Every feature in PRODUCT.md MUST be built — splitting into sub-batches changes HOW MANY
things are built per session, never WHAT gets built. Skipping or deferring features
without explicit human approval is a governance violation.

**Rule:** AFTER the batch is confirmed but BEFORE writing any code, Claude Code MUST:

1. **Scope assessment** — list every file that will be created or modified across ALL items
   in this batch (routers, services, pages, components, tests, migrations, types)
2. **Estimate the token cost:** CLAUDE.md (~5K) + active rules file (~3K) + PRODUCT.md
   sections (~2-4K each) + existing source files to read (~1-3K each) + governance
   docs (~10-15K) + output generation (~2-5K per file). If total exceeds 80K → MUST split.
3. IF the batch scope exceeds 12 files to create/modify OR estimated context exceeds
   80K tokens → the batch MUST be sub-divided into per-feature sub-batches.
   Do NOT attempt to build multiple features in one session.
4. Report the sub-division plan:
   ```
   ⚠ Phase 8 Batch [N] scope assessment: [X] features, ~[Y] files, ~[Z]K estimated tokens.
   Exceeds 80K SAFE zone. Splitting into sub-batches:
     Batch [N]-1 — [FeatureName]: [list of files] (~[N]K tokens)
     Batch [N]-2 — [FeatureName]: [list of files] (~[N]K tokens)
     Batch [N]-3 — [FeatureName]: [list of files] (~[N]K tokens)
   Starting with Batch [N]-1. I'll commit and stop after each sub-batch.
   ```
5. IF the batch scope is ≤12 files AND estimated context ≤80K → proceed as a single session.
6. The human may also FORCE sub-division at any time by saying:
   "Split this batch by feature" — even if the threshold is not reached.

**Per sub-batch rules (when sub-divided):**
- Read ONLY the PRODUCT.md sections for the current feature — do NOT read the entire file
  (a full PRODUCT.md can be 20-40K tokens alone — reading it all defeats the purpose)
- Read ONLY the codebase files relevant to the current feature
- Use codebase_search (Rule 17) to find specific symbols instead of opening files for context
- If you need a shared component or utility, read ONLY that single file — not the whole directory
- Cross-reference against PRODUCT.md before completing: verify every field, validation rule,
  permission, and UI element described for this feature is actually implemented
- Run tests for this feature
- Update governance docs for this feature (CHANGELOG_AI, IMPLEMENTATION_MAP, agent-log)
- Commit with message: "feat([feature-slug]): [what was built]"
- Update STATE.md with:
  ```
  Phase 8 Batch [N] progress:
    ✅ [N]-1 [FeatureName] — DONE ([files created/modified])
    ⬜ [N]-2 [FeatureName] — REMAINING
    ⬜ [N]-3 [FeatureName] — REMAINING
  Dependencies for next sub-batch: [any shared code or DB changes this sub-batch created
  that the next one needs to know about]
  ```
- STOP. Do NOT start the next feature. Human opens a new session.

**Completeness check (MANDATORY before marking a sub-batch DONE):**
Before committing, Claude Code MUST re-read the PRODUCT.md section for the current feature
and verify:
  □ Every user flow described is implemented (happy path + error states)
  □ Every data field in the entity is present in the Prisma schema, tRPC router, and UI form
  □ Every permission/role guard matches the Roles & Permissions table
  □ Every validation rule in the spec has a matching Zod schema
  □ Every UI element described (buttons, tables, filters, modals) exists in the page
  □ If the feature connects to another module, the integration point is wired
  □ design:check: exit 0 — run `npm run design:check` (Playwright toHaveScreenshot vs production
    baseline in tests/visual/fixtures/). Non-zero exit = visual drift = GATE FAIL. Two legal
    reconcile paths: fix code, OR update-design-first → design:validate → design:build → re-capture
    baseline as reviewed human commit → re-run design:check. (V32.8 — Rule 31)
  □ REGISTRY DONE-CLAIM (V32.8 — Rule 32): scan LESSONS_REGISTRY.md for fingerprints matching
    this batch's surface; capture design:check output + acceptance check into STATE.md
    {contract, check_command, captured_output}. Empty evidence field = malformed claim.
IF any item is missing → implement it before committing. Do NOT leave it for a future batch
unless the human explicitly says to defer it.

**Phase 8 failure handling (V32.8 — Rule 32):** On any build/test/gate failure during a sub-batch:
  1. Fingerprint the failure: {scope_category, surface, symptom, check_command_that_caught_it}
  2. Scan LESSONS_REGISTRY.md for a matching fingerprint.
  3. IF matches an existing entry whose standing_check should have caught it: STRENGTHEN that check.
  4. IF novel: flag as a promotion candidate in STATE.md ("promote-to-registry: YES").

**If thrashing occurs mid-session despite sub-division:**
1. Immediately run `/clear` to reset context
2. Update STATE.md with exact progress (which files done, which pending for THIS feature)
3. Write a handoff note to `.cline/handoffs/` with: what's done, what's remaining,
   any partial code that needs completion
4. Commit all work done so far (even if incomplete — partial progress > lost progress)
5. STOP — human opens a new session with narrower scope for the remaining work

**Why this matters:** Phase 8 batches that thrash produce the most dangerous kind of bug —
features that LOOK complete in IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md but are actually missing validations,
permission guards, error states, or entire user flows. The completeness check catches this
before it becomes invisible tech debt.

**Adaptive replanning after each batch (NEW V14 — from GSD-2):**
After every batch completes, BEFORE proposing the next batch:
1. Re-read PRODUCT.md and IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md.
2. Check: does anything learned during this batch change the remaining items?
   - Did a technical constraint emerge that makes item X harder or impossible?
   - Did implementing item A reveal that item B needs to be split into two?
   - Did a decision lock out a previously planned approach?
3. IF the remaining plan needs to change: show the proposed change + reason. Ask confirmation before updating.
4. IF the plan is still valid: proceed with next batch proposal as normal.
Output EXACTLY:
```
🔄 ROADMAP CHECK after batch [N]
Remaining items reviewed: [count]
Plan change needed: YES / NO
[If YES: what changes and why]
[If NO: "Remaining plan is still valid — proceeding to next batch"]
```

**When PRODUCT.md is fully implemented → generate README.md:**
```
README.md must include:

## Running the App
  Start all services:    bash deploy/compose/start.sh dev up -d
  Stop all services:     bash deploy/compose/start.sh dev down
  Restart a service:     docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.[service].yml restart

## Development Commands (run in WSL2 terminal)
  Install dependencies:  pnpm install
  Start dev server:      pnpm dev
  Run tests:             pnpm test
  Type check:            pnpm typecheck
  Lint:                  pnpm lint
  Build:                 pnpm build

## Database
  Run migrations:        pnpm db:migrate
  Seed dev data:         pnpm db:seed
  Reset DB:              pnpm db:reset
  Open Prisma Studio:    pnpm db:studio
  Generate client:       pnpm db:generate

## Governance Tools
  Validate spec:         pnpm tools:validate-inputs
  Check env vars:        pnpm tools:check-env
  Check sync:            pnpm tools:check-product-sync
  Hydration lint:        pnpm tools:hydration-lint
  Log a lesson:          bash scripts/log-lesson.sh
                         (or VS Code: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks: Run Task → Log Lesson)

## Adding Features (the everyday workflow)
  1. Edit docs/PRODUCT.md — describe the change in plain English
  2. Say "Feature Update" in Claude Code — Claude Code implements everything automatically
  3. Run: pnpm tools:check-product-sync && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test

## Codebase Search (SocratiCode)
  Index codebase:        ask Claude Code "Index this codebase"
  Update index:          codebase_update {} (Claude Code does this automatically after Feature Update)
  Requires:              Docker running

## SpecStory — Change History
  All sessions auto-captured to .specstory/history/
  Attribution reconciliation: say "Governance Sync" in Claude Code

## Service URLs (dev/test — ports assigned during Phase 3, stored in .env.dev)
  View all ports:        cat .env.dev | grep _PORT
  App:                   http://localhost:${APP_PORT}
  MinIO console:         http://localhost:${MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT}
  pgAdmin (DB UI):       http://localhost:${PGADMIN_PORT}   (credentials in .env.dev)
  MailHog (email):       http://localhost:${MAILHOG_PORT}
  Prisma Studio:         http://localhost:${STUDIO_PORT} (when pnpm db:studio is running)
```

## SESSION RESUME
**Trigger:** "Resume Session" + attach 3 docs:
`project.memory.md` + `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md` + `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md`

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Resume reads 3 docs (~5-10K tokens) then continues the previous phase. After resuming, apply the context budget pre-flight for whatever phase you're continuing — estimate scope before building.

**Output EXACTLY this format:**
```
✅ Session restored — [App Name from project.memory.md]

BUILT SO FAR:
  [list each completed phase or feature from IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md]

LOCKED DECISIONS:
  [list each locked decision from DECISIONS_LOG.md — one line each]

ACTIVE DEV MODE: MODE A — WSL2 native (only supported environment)
ACTIVE RULES: V32.8 — 32 rules. Rule 4 (read 9 docs first), Rule 17 (SocratiCode search), Rule 18 (typed lessons), Rule 21 (design system), Rule 22 (random ports + container naming, WSL2 native only), Rule 23 (git branching), Rule 24 (fresh context), Rule 25 (two-stage review), Rule 28 (priority ladder), Rule 29 (no fuzzy), Rule 30 (Context7). H1–H4 System Hardening active. UI Component Rules active (V29). Compact CLAUDE.md architecture active (V30). Claude Sonnet 4.6 primary (V30). Phase 2.8 Clickable Mockup Review active in Planning Assistant chat (V31).

Which phase are you continuing from?
```

---

## GOVERNANCE RETRO
**Trigger:** "Governance Retro" — Claude Code reads agent-log.md + CHANGELOG_AI.md + git log automatically

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Retro reads governance logs which can be large on mature projects. If agent-log.md + CHANGELOG_AI.md exceed 40K tokens combined, read only the last 2 weeks of entries.

```
📋 GOVERNANCE RETRO — [date range]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT WAS BUILT
  ✅ [feature/fix] — [date] — Agent: [who]

ERRORS ENCOUNTERED AND RESOLVED
  🔧 [error type] — [date] — Fix: [what resolved it]

WHAT IS STILL IN PROGRESS
  ⏳ [item] — started [date], last touched [date]

GOVERNANCE HEALTH
  Rule 9 violations caught:  [count]
  Handoff files written:     [count]
  Lessons added to memory:   [count]
  Unattributed SpecStory diffs reconciled: [count]

VELOCITY
  Features shipped this week:  [count]
  Average feature cycle time:  [estimated from CHANGELOG timestamps]

RECOMMENDED FOCUS FOR NEXT SESSION
  [top 2–3 items from Phase 8 "not yet built" list]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## GOVERNANCE SYNC
**Trigger:**
- Via Claude Code: say "Governance Sync" — it reads all 9 governance docs + .specstory/history/ automatically
- Via Copilot (emergency fallback only): say "Governance Sync" + attach all 9 docs manually
- Conflict resolution variant: "Governance Sync — conflict resolution"

> **⚠ CONTEXT BUDGET:** Governance Sync reads 9 docs + SpecStory history. On mature projects this can exceed 80K tokens. If .specstory/history/ has many entries, read only entries since the last CHANGELOG timestamp — not the full history.

**Governance Sync reads SpecStory history for attribution reconciliation:**

```
CASE A — code drifted, PRODUCT.md untouched:
  "Governance Sync" + attach 9 docs
  Agent reads .specstory/history/ for diffs since last CHANGELOG entry
  Matches diffs to agent sessions → attributes COPILOT or HUMAN where no session found
  Shows reconciliation table → asks confirmation
  Updates CHANGELOG_AI.md with attributed entries

CASE B — code AND PRODUCT.md both changed:
  "Governance Sync — conflict resolution" + 9 docs
  Agent shows conflict table. You resolve each contradiction.
  Agent updates all governance docs + attributes SpecStory diffs.

Prevention: run Phase 7 for any change > 5 lines. One Governance Sync per day max.
```

---

## OPTIONAL TOGGLES (applied via Phase 7)

```yaml
tenancy:
  mode: multi

deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

apps:
  - name: admin
    framework: next
    port: null  # Phase 3 assigns a random port from ports.dev.base+12 — never hardcode

jobs:
  enabled: true
  provider: bullmq

storage:
  enabled: true
  provider: minio
```

## HUMAN GUIDE — HOW TO ADD FEATURES OR CHANGE ANYTHING

> **Golden rule: edit `docs/PRODUCT.md` only. Agents do the rest.**

### LOG LESSON — Human quick-log for personal discoveries

**When to use:** You personally discovered something mid-session — a gotcha, a fix, a decision — and want it in lessons.md immediately in Rule 18 typed format, without waiting for Claude Code to write it after a completed task.

**Examples of when this is useful:**
- You found that a service port conflicts with another project running on the same machine
- You made a manual config decision outside of Claude Code (e.g. a .env choice)
- You learned something from the docs or a blog post that's directly relevant to your project
- You want to pre-warn Claude Code about a known pitfall before it hits it

**How to trigger:**
```
VS Code Command Palette → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Log Lesson"
```
Or from the WSL2 terminal:
```bash
bash scripts/log-lesson.sh
```

**What it asks (5 questions, ~30 seconds):**
1. Type? [1=🔴 gotcha  2=🟡 fix  3=🟤 decision  4=⚖️ trade-off  5=🟢 change]
2. Short title
3. Affected files (or "none")
4. Keywords / concepts
5. What happened and why does it matter?

**Output:** Appends a correctly formatted Rule 18 entry to `.cline/memory/lessons.md` immediately.
Claude Code reads it with correct priority (🔴 first) next session — no extra steps needed.

**Rule:** Never write free-form text to lessons.md directly. Always use this script or let Claude Code write it. The typed format is what allows Claude Code to read gotchas first and decisions second.


### ⚠️ CRITICAL — Never re-run Phase 2 on an existing project

For any change after Phase 4 — always use Phase 7.

If you accidentally re-ran Phase 2:
1. Say "STOP. Do not generate files. I accidentally re-ran Phase 2."
2. Attach 9 existing context docs
3. Ask agent to reconstruct inputs.yml from codebase + governance docs
4. Confirm reconstruction → proceed with Phase 7
