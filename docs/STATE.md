## Current State — Clean-Slate Scaffold (swarm/rebuild · S1 complete, 2026-06-12)

PHASE:        **Phase 4 — Clean-Slate Scaffold-then-Wire rebuild** (driven by the swarm session plan
              on branch `swarm/rebuild`). S0 (re-baseline) + S1 (Parts 1–2 scaffold) are complete.

              ⚠ PLAN CORRECTION (S0): The prior STATE.md falsely claimed "Phase 3.5 COMPLETE · Parts 1–8
              already BUILT in May 2026 V31 adoption — actual remaining work is the prototype→production
              wiring." That premise was INVALID. The V32.6.1 clean-slate wipe (2026-06-07, commit `0a94f48`)
              removed `apps/` and `packages/` from the filesystem. They do NOT exist on `swarm/rebuild`
              or `main` (the old scaffold survives only in git history on `scaffold/part-3`).
              IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md is authoritative: "Filesystem: clean-slate. No apps/, packages/."
              The Phase 3.5 execution plan (`.cline/tasks/execution-plan.md`) was written against the
              false brownfield assumption and is therefore SUPERSEDED by the swarm scaffold-then-wire plan.

FILESYSTEM REALITY (verified this session):
  PRESENT:  docs/ (PRODUCT.md + 9 governance docs), prototype/ (Phase 3.3 sim layer, 9/9 flows signed off),
            deploy/, mockup-server/, inputs.yml, inputs.schema.json, 4 env files, CREDENTIALS.md,
            .gitignore, .mcp.json, .vscode/mcp.json, .cline/ (memory + tasks), scripts/, CLAUDE.md.
            NEW (S1): package.json + pnpm-workspace.yaml (catalog) + turbo.json + tsconfig.base.json +
            eslint.config.mjs + .prettierrc/.prettierignore/.editorconfig + .nvmrc + pnpm-lock.yaml +
            node_modules/ + packages/shared/ (@yelli/shared — types + Zod + reserved-slugs + audit vocab).
            ⇒ `pnpm install|typecheck|lint` now run green. `pnpm build|test` are no-ops until a package
              defines those tasks (shared is source-exported; tests land later).
  ABSENT:   apps/ , packages/db , packages/ui , packages/jobs , tools/.
            ⇒ `pnpm tools:validate-inputs` not wired yet (tools/ lands in S5). apps/yelli lands in S4.

LAST_DONE (S1 — Scaffold Parts 1–2: root config + packages/shared):
  - **Root monorepo config** — package.json (pnpm@10.33.2, turbo-delegating scripts), pnpm-workspace.yaml
    (apps/* + packages/* + pnpm `catalog:` — phantom-ui 0.10.1 EXACT [Loading Library Lock], zod, typescript),
    turbo.json (turbo 2.x `tasks`), tsconfig.base.json (strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess +
    exactOptionalPropertyTypes — Rule 12), eslint.config.mjs (ESLint 9 flat; no-explicit-any: error),
    .prettierrc/.prettierignore/.editorconfig, .nvmrc=22.
  - **packages/shared (@yelli/shared)** — source-exported type + validation contract for all downstream sessions:
      • enums.ts (Edition, CallRole, UserRole, CallEndReason, ExportJobStatus, AuditTargetType — tuple+union).
      • audit.ts — AUDIT_ACTIONS (§11-canonical, 29 actions) verbatim from docs/PROTOTYPE.md §3 (the signed-off
        lock; NOT PRODUCT.md's illustrative line-204 enum). HARD CONSTRAINT inherited by S2 + W4 + W1/W2/W3.
      • entities.ts — 8 domain interfaces (Date timestamps = Prisma runtime shape).
      • config/reserved-slugs.ts — RESERVED_SLUGS (18, verbatim) + isReservedSlug().
      • validators.ts — Zod (tenantSlug 3–30/regex/no-`--`/reserved → generic "slug unavailable" per V25;
        display-name caps 40/24/24; email; fingerprint; UUID idempotency key; enum schemas).
  - **Validation green** — pnpm install ✓; typecheck ✓ (0 errors); lint ✓ (0 problems); build/test no-op exit 0;
    prettier --check ✓. 465 lines total (within the 500-line dispatch budget). 1 self-caught import typo fixed inline.
  - **CHANGELOG_AI.md appended** — full S1 entry (Rule 15 attribution; audit-vocabulary divergence resolved).

LAST_DONE (S0 — Re-baseline + inputs.yml regen):
  - **docs/STATE.md rewritten** (this file) — reconciled to the real clean-slate state; corrected the
    false Phase 3.5 brownfield-complete claim per authoritative IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md.
  - **inputs.yml regenerated** from docs/PRODUCT.md — drift corrected and validated against inputs.schema.json:
      • entities: replaced fabricated `BrandAsset / CallSnapshot / SessionInvalidation` (not in PRODUCT.md)
        with the 8 PRODUCT.md domain models — Tenant, User, Device, Invitation, AuditLog, CallSession,
        WebPushSubscription, ExportJob (Auth.js owns Session/VerificationToken/Account separately).
      • modules: 6 → 8 faithful (calling, directory, device-identity, accounts-auth, tenancy-members,
        branding, admin-console, pwa).
      • jobs.queues: 2 → 6 (device-archive, tenant-export, soft-delete-cron, backup, email, logo-image) —
        grounded in DECISIONS_LOG.md "LOCKED: Jobs + Queues" (Step 5) + "LOCKED: Database Backup" (Step 7).
      • tenancy.notes: clarified hybrid LAN+Cloud one-codebase model.
      • security.audit_events: aligned to the PRODUCT.md AuditLog action prefixes
        (member.* / device.* / tenant.* / auth.* / superadmin.* / lan.* / pwa.*).
      • inputs.yml VALID against inputs.schema.json (jsonschema check passed in sandbox).
  - **Phase 0 skeleton verified intact** — governance docs, .gitignore (comprehensive), and MCP wiring
    (.mcp.json + .vscode/mcp.json: socraticode + context7 + shadcn) all present and correct. No repair needed.
  - **CHANGELOG_AI.md appended** — clean-slate re-baseline + plan-correction entry (Rule 15 attribution).

NEXT:
  1. **S2 — Scaffold Part 3: packages/db** (Prisma schema — the contract for all wiring; AT_RISK). 8 domain
     models + 3 Auth.js-managed (Session/VerificationToken/Account) + 4 enums; L2 RLS, L5 AuditLog, L6
     tenant-guard extension; User.securityVersion; migration 0001. Field shapes derive from PRODUCT.md Data
     Entities and must align 1:1 with @yelli/shared entities.ts (S1) — same field names + the AUDIT_ACTIONS vocab.
  2. Then S3 (packages/ui + packages/jobs) → S4 (apps/yelli Next.js + shadcn + Auth.js + tRPC skeleton; AT_RISK)
     → S5 (deploy + CI).
  3. Then W1–W8 wire the validated prototype/ flows to the real backend (swap sim layer for tRPC/Prisma),
     finishing with W8 pre-production validation (9 §3 flows end-to-end + Phase 5 re-run + Visual QA).
  Output Equivalence: the scaffold-then-wire rebuild must reproduce the proven decisions in DECISIONS_LOG.md
  and the 9 signed-off §3 flows in PROTOTYPE.md — nothing is re-decided, only re-built.

BLOCKERS:     none for S1. S2 unblocked (depends only on S1, now complete).

GIT_BRANCH:   swarm/rebuild. S1 adds 1 atomic commit (root config + packages/shared + pnpm-lock.yaml +
              docs/STATE.md + docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md). The human reviews and pushes — the worker never pushes.
              Recent commits:
  - `dddb647` feat(phase-4-S0): Re-baseline + inputs.yml regen (Bootstrap)
  - `552d8ad` chore(phase-3.5): execution plan generated — 9 sessions, brownfield-aware  ← premise corrected by S0
  - `2a5b1dc` chore(phase-3.3): client sign-off + STATE.md gate-closure

PORTS:        Phase 4 app dev port = 46848 (inputs.yml ports.dev.app). prototype/ dev server on 4838
              (Phase 3.3 validated baseline, retained for Phase 4 spot-checks).

MODELS:
  planning:   claude-code (Opus — architect)
  execution:  claude-sonnet-4-6 via Claude Code
  governance: gemini-2.5-flash-lite

CHECKPOINT TYPE: full (scaffold session — 18 files created + 2 governance docs updated; 1 atomic commit)
LINES_TOUCHED: ~465 lines of new scaffold (root config + packages/shared) + CHANGELOG_AI.md + this STATE.md
FILES_TOUCHED (S1):
  - root: package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json, eslint.config.mjs,
    .prettierrc, .prettierignore, .editorconfig, .nvmrc, pnpm-lock.yaml (generated)
  - packages/shared: package.json, tsconfig.json, eslint.config.mjs,
    src/index.ts, src/enums.ts, src/audit.ts, src/entities.ts, src/validators.ts, src/config/reserved-slugs.ts
  - docs/STATE.md (this file), docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md (appended)
TIER_CLASSIFICATION: Tier 1 — lightweight (465 lines total, within the 500-line budget; single executor)

EXECUTION NOTE (Rule 15 / V32.1): This swarm worker runs headless (`claude -p`) as a single executor agent
  and performs its own file writes inline — sub-agent dispatch is not used in this harness. This is the
  standing V32.1 Opus-inline fallback pattern (documented; env-structural, not a discretionary R1 bypass).

KNOWN STANDING ISSUES (carried into the scaffold/wire sessions):
  - V32.1 dispatch-layer regression (env-structural). Standing fallback: inline writes by the worker.
  - 4 Phase 3.3 deferrals carry into the wire sessions: (1) Flow E LAN-admin-login re-render no-op (W1);
    (2-4) overlay heading semantics + next/font/google migration + hex→CSS-var wiring (W7).
  - Old `.cline/tasks/execution-plan.md` (136L) reflects the superseded brownfield premise — retained
    for reference only; the swarm S0→S5→W1–W8 plan is authoritative for Phase 4.
